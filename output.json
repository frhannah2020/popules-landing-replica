    "text": "Hi all, your friendly r/bigbangtheory mod here with a few reminders on some rules based on the types of reports we've been seeing recently:\n\n1. AI is low effort. That decision was made a while ago. If you see it, report it. That said, it's not always easy to tell what is or is t AI so some may slip past moderation.\n\n2. Post and comments from the social media site X and posts or comments about the owner of X and his appearance on TBBT are not permitted.\n\n3. We are pretty liberal about what is considered in topic, so non duplicate and interesting posts about things like flags, trains, and actors appearances in other media are all fine within moderator discretion.\n\nThanks for being a part of this sub and let's remember to be kind with one another and let the mods handle it when someone isn't."

As we eagerly await the premiere of the now fully in production series Stuart Fails to Save the Universe featuring some of our favorite side characters from TBBT (I'm a Bert guy) and, apparently, off-brand versions of the leads in the various alt universes, news about the show will continue to be welcome here until the show actually is released.\n\nOnce that occurs, then anything that happens is part of that show, not TBBT.  Therefore, all discussion of the show should move over to r/sftstu the official sub* for the show.\n\nThank you.\n\n\\* To paraphrase another beloved sitcom, I don't know how official any of these subs really are."

Yes, it is a standard sitcom with the general population as the target, but it wasn‚Äôt number one for so long because it sucked. \nAlso, growing up if you even hinted that you knew what ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù things were you were automatically a nerd and loser. Star Trek, MTG, and god forbid that you knew what dungeons and dragons was. My dad was a total geek and so I knew all of this stuff but didn‚Äôt want anyone else to know I knew. When this show came out I was in awe that people started to change their views. I remember watching the culture change. It was insane. Slowly, becoming more geeky or nerdy was cool. \nAll thanks to a show that people that identify as geeks/nerds say is making fun of them. (It is, just like it makes fun of a lot of other stuff) without TBBT, it still might not be ok to admit you were into this stuff. "

But seriously, did we need Raj teasing Howard about his cousin to ruin what should have been a fun night for everyone? Hell, I normally can't stand the whole Raj and Emily pairing, but her presence in this episode was hardly an issue by comparison. And then there's Stuart. He finally has a girl who seems to like him, and the second Mrs. Wolowitz calls he abandons her? And don't get me started on his making those Yiddish comments in the limo. Coming from Stuart, that sounded so forced, and extremely cringey. I had to skip past those scenes back to the ones at the apartment."

Now, again tbbt has a spin off/ sequel for stuart coming soon as, \"stuart fails to save the universe\". \n\nTbvh the show loses it's essence when they make so much prequel, sequel, sequel of the prequel spinoff stuff. They're just milking stuff from the one show that went successful, doesn't chuck lorre has ANYTHING to do than ruining the essence of the show for people? I mean if you're really worked up then make a continuation of tbbt NOT OF SIDE CHARACTERS FFS. \n\nNot to mention, a lot of inconsistencies in young sheldon, for one the younger sheldon is somehow more mature than the sheldon that appeared in the earlier seasons? How is that possible? The home's infrastructure has changed too, in tbbt when sheldon was angry he ran home, his mom said the table they sat on wasthe very one they used to sit on when he was a child. The home from back then is clearly not what young sheldon depicts. Tbbt in itself had lots of inconsistencies but the least they could have done, was to make the prequel accurate.\n\n(The greatest inaccuracy is how they talk shit about george in tbbt and how mary is even happy from his death, he is shown as a great dad  in the prequel arguably much better than mary even. He didn't cheat, dare someone bring up sheldon's knocking habit, how he walked in on his dad doing a blonde woman but in the prequel it's just mary dressed up, it was not the only time he cheated according to tbbt.)"

    "text": "I‚Äôm re-watching the series for the millionth time and I‚Äôm noticing that penny picks odd things to be stubborn about and or angry about. If we‚Äôve talked about this before, I‚Äôm sorry. I looked to see and didn‚Äôt think anyone had mentioned this and if they had, it‚Äôs been a while. Plus, I just kind of needed to rant a little about this. \n\nFirst, we have the whole musician friend sleeping on her couch thing. How in the world does she not understand why Leonard would be upset about this? She‚Äôs invited half of California into her bed and in a few episodes has talked about both how quickly she moves on, and how many people she will be with on and off at the same time. She acts like she‚Äôs the one in the wrong, but I‚Äôm pretty sure most people would be uncomfortable with this, especially if they learned that she end that friend of hers had slept together before. It‚Äôs not an irrational thing to be angry about.\n\nWe also have the whole psychic thing. Yes, Leonard shouldn‚Äôt have made fun of it, but when they make up, Penny asks him to visit her psychic, and he agrees and asks her to read a book on why psychics are completely illogical, and she immediately shut that down. It‚Äôs funny, yes, but pretty close minded on her part because she will make Leonard do whatever she wants and listen to whatever she wants him to listen to, but she won‚Äôt do the same thing for him. \n\nWith the whole beta test thing for their relationship, she gets angry when Leonard gives her that list, but the thing is, beforehand, she had been nitpicking every single thing that he did. The only difference was that he waited, actually thought about it, and wrote everything down. Plus, she doesn‚Äôt even mention being upset. She just decides to get petty and make an even longer list for him with completely ridiculous additions. \n\nDo not get me wrong, I‚Äôm not saying Leonard is perfect. I‚Äôm not saying that Penney is always wrong, and I‚Äôm not saying that Leonard is always right. What I am saying, however, is that Penny seems to have a massive temper and can be incredibly close-minded, and refuses to admit when she herself is wrong. I know there are more examples, but I‚Äôm blanking right now. Let me know if you can think of any others. "

    "text": "Been rewatching some episodes lately, and reminded just how much I disliked how they wrote Penny in later seasons. She goes from telling Leonard she loves him and being a better girlfriend. Even telling him she only needs him to be happy at the end of season 7.\n\nTo doing things like moving his nerdy things out of their apartment slowly so he won‚Äôt notice. Only agreeing that working for an ex wasn‚Äôt a good idea once his current girlfriend had an issue with it and seeing it wasn‚Äôt just Leonard that had the issue with it.\n\nOn the topic of Zack. Not getting why Leonard was upset with her for giving Zack the laptop he gave her. Only admitting she was wrong when Zack still had it, and saying you don‚Äôt give away something like that.\n\nI really hated how she said she didn‚Äôt want kids. Finally giving in to Leonard donating his sperm to Zack and his wife, only to throw him under the bus to her father and try to seduce him. Instead of having an adult conversation.\n\nGot upset when Leonard got comfortable in their relationship after marriage. Something you‚Äôd think she‚Äôd actually like. But no acted all pissy and went out of town with Amy. Then gets mad at Leonard for showing up and making and effort to fix things.\n\nShe got pissy about him having a secret bank account. When she‚Äôs the one with massive debt. Even hints that she would blow through at least a good bit of it asking if he knew what she could do with that kind of money.\n\nLast one I‚Äôll list here is getting mad at him for him being upset at her seemingly not remembering their first kiss. Something that was clearly special and meaningful. Instead of being an adult and explaining why she didn‚Äôt want to view that as their first kiss. She acts like she doesn‚Äôt remember and leads then to have arguments "

(A clip of a character saying \"our\" followed by one of a different character saying \"whole\" then one of another character saying \"universe\" etc.) While the clips were shown, the instrumental version of the theme song (from the closing credits) played. I loved this video and thought it was very creative, but, like I said, I sadly can't find it anywhere anymore.

    "text": "So season 8 episode 17, Howard starts playing Xbox while Bernadette is doing the taxes.  She starts grilling him about all the receipts from the Lego store.  Specially a $200 R2D2.  That bugged me.  Because like a season before, Amy drags Sheldon to a Valentine's dinner on a train.  \n\nAt the dinner Sheldon meets a guy who's also obsessed with trains and wanders off to the engine to meet the conductor.  Bernadette consoles Amy and says \"To be honest I bet Howard $200 it was gonna happen.\"  In reference to Amy being able to convince Sheldon to come.  Howard makes a quirky grin and says \"I'm going to the Lego store and buy me a big ass R2D2.\"\n\nNow.  We can take that as a joke.  Or we can assume that he's serious.  Which I typically do.  He makes jokes constantly but you can tell there's a lot of genuine truth behind his jokes most of the time.  In that one you can tell he's being totally serious despite making a joke.\n\nThat all comes together with Bernadette pointing out the purchase.  So he did in fact buy it.  But if the bet was valid, and he did in fact go buy the R2D2, why is she complaining.  That makes me mad.  If she bet him $200, and he said that's what he was spending it on, cause she totally lost the bet, then she has no grounds to stand on.\n\nPlease debate this.  I need to know if I'm crazy."

If she had just sympathized with him, I could let it go, but she  joined his war against it. And in the end the others only turn against it because Sheldon acted like a baby. Man, I hate this episode.\n3. Dressed up like Bernadette to spite her just because she wouldn't make Howard apologize for his Sheldon costume. I 100% believe these two were in the wrong in this episode. Sure, Howard might have overdid his impression of Sheldon, but A. If it hadn't been pointed out to him he never would've known it was him and B. Sheldon treats Howard like crap all the time and no one bats an eye, yet when  Howard fights back all of a sudden he's the bully?\n4. The tenant association episode could've been avoided if she stuck up for Penny and Leonard, but she didn't. Sheldon didn't even pull any \"relationship agreement\" crap to make her side with him or anything, she just sat by and did nothing."

    "text": "So I had this idea today for an other spinn-off in the TBBT Universe. It would present in as movie the backstrory of every main character (except Sheldon) before they meet the story of the show so the other characters, so for example the story of Raj would go all the way to the moment he met Howard. The movie would present the story of Leonard, Howard, Raj, Penny, Amy and Bernadette together, where the different scenes jump from one character to another and so all the six stories continue at the same time. The movie will present a part of their childhood, some of the older teen years and then the years when they finally meet the other characters. I love listening to their background stories and I think that the movie format is the best because creating a single movie or show out of one character is too much I think, obviously it would also work as a new series of episodes where a couple of episodes are dedicated to one character or they are all mixed up. Tell me your opinion about this in the comment sectio, thanks for your attention and have a great day yall!"

    "text": "POSSIBLE SPOILER for those who haven't watched the show.\n\nOn my umpteenth rewatch of the show, noticed a couple of things. Perhaps this has been discussed earlier in this sub but still here goes:\n\n1. In the Physics Bowl episode (1x13) the boys are wondering whom to replace Sheldon with in their Physics Bowl team and Raj suggests the girl from Blossom who has a PhD in Neuroscience.\n\nI paused the episode for sec and thought hey doesn't Mayim Bialik have a PhD? A quick Google search result later - I was right! Raj was referring to her. So Mayim Bialik is canon on the show but Amy being a lookalike of the actress isn't noticed by anyone.\n\nSeems like the old Friends error wherein Die Hard fans Joey and Chandler don't notice Bruce Willis on the show.\n\n2) In the next episode (the one where they buy a full size time machine), Leonard mentions that the elevator was broken for 2 years. \n\nIn later episodes we are shown a flashback to when Leonard moves into Sheldon's apartment and Sheldon eventually saves everyone's life by putting that explosive experiment into the elevator which caused it to break.\n\nNow if I'm not wrong - as of season 1, haven't Sheldon and Leonard already stayed together for 5 years? Timeline issue there it seems.\n\nAny thoughts about these and maybe future errors are welcome :)"
