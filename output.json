Well they changed their mind when I got back. Well, don't wanna play video games with me? You don't get to play Xbox with your friends either.\n\nOne of them has been leaving his shit all over the house. So I just disconnect his iPhone for a bit. I don't mention it either. Wanna use your phone now? I know you have a data cap that you'll be blasting right through without wifi.\n\nJust as I wrote this, I disconnected his Xbox, then reconnected for five minutes, then disconnected again.\n\nEdit: Well it's been fun guys.

    "text": "A few days ago, I take a call on my cell from an “unknown number.”  I’m in the process of selling my house, so I’m answering everything. \n\nThere is a slight pause between when I say “Hello” and when the speaker starts speaking. A tell-tale sign it’s from a call center. \nThe person on the other end immediately starts with telling me something I couldn’t understand because of her heavy Indian accent (India) and telling me “this is in regards to the order you placed, with order number 1984726374” (not the exact number but about the same length). In the background, I hear a bunch of talking.\n\nI am sooo sick of scams from India. \nSo, I put on my jolly voice and say, “Oh really? Order number 1984736374?” (I’m pretty sure I got it right repeating it) and followed up with, “ I’ve been Sooo waiting to hear from you!”\n\nTher is a noticeable pause on the other end, and she says “yes sir this is in reference to order number (repeate number) we need you to validate…\n\nAnd interrupt with “Lady, I can do this Alll day long. How long do you want to play this game?”\n\nAgain another pause, with noise in the background. She repeats herself and Intakk over her telling her, “you know what? Actually, I don’t have time for this.” And I pull the phone away from my ear, and hang up. \n\nBut here’s the thing. Just as I am hanging up, she says something “medical” and my brain SNAPS to attention. \n\nI had just ordered more injection needles (I have a condition they requires weekly injections… I buy a box of 100 needles about every 2 years)… the medical place I get them from requires evidence of a prescription, either from my doc, or my actual prescription.\n\nI walk over to my computer load up my email… and there it is. From the medical supplies company. \n“Regarding order #1984726374…we need a prescription to be uploaded.”\n\nI totally racially profiled that Lady because she had an Indian accent. I get dozens of calls every month that start the exact same way, and are scams. \n\nThat poor lady probably gets yelled at ALL DAY LONG, simoly because her lying countrymen scam Americans all day long. \n\nNot her fault. I felt like garbage. Sure… I didn’t call her any names or anything, I was just a happy jerk about the whole thing. But still… there it is. My confession. I am dad-gum racist idiot. I need to do better."

    "text": "Pretty simple as the title states. Fyi the story is boring so skip to the bottom for to;dr.\n\nI (36M and gay) was having a flip-fucking sexual, but not boyfriend-boyfriend, behind the scenes week fling with my dad’s best friend (55M). AKA- fuck buddies.\n\nLet’s call him Jacob to make this easier. My dad and his friends, about 6 dudes total, always have a yearly friend meet up in a random US state they’ve never visited before (17/50 states visited). I’ve only been on this trip once, I think the 2nd or 3rd state, post-college and they’re fun, regular dudes drinking, talking crap, and visiting historical sites while tying in some fishing where they can. Since my first time with them I did 2 cycles of steroids, stuck to the gym, and kept a healthy lifestyle. Cue last year (35M) and I was invited again because they chose 1 neighboring state away from where I live to visit/vacation (I moved out of state for work after college). \n\nAnyway, my flight was delayed and I arrived at the hotel around 10 pm. Dad and his friends are at the hotel restaurant already tipsy as I arrived after I quickly showered. I get seated next to Jacob, who divorced his wife a few years ago, and things are fine but the drinking continues. Jacob’s leg touches mine, I move mine away - no harm no foul. The guys make a comment about my arms and Jacob gropes it, all good lol. Dinner ends and we head back to our rooms. My room is on the 5th floor and so is Jacob’s ;) while everyone else is on either the 4th and 1st floor (my dad is the monster who always asks for the 1st floor). \n\nJacob doesn’t stop saying how my physique is impressive. I fess up and tell him I did steroids after college, but still kept with the exercise routines. One thing led to another and I’m on his bed receiving a massage. I felt something dense (LOL) back there and yeah, Jacob is hard as a rock. I get banged and we flip after some effort on my part to help Jacob… open up. Worst mistake ever; it was a risk and my poor dick had chocolate fondant that night. He felt bad and I educate him on how to douche and inform him about fiber gummies. \n\nAnyway, the fucking continues throughout the entire week. No more chocolate topping incidents. The vacation ends and we have very sparse communication which fizzles out. No biggie. I saw him again this year and he’s in a relationship with a woman. That’s fine except he’s eye fucking me and I catch him several times. For me this is over because I’ve been cheated on before (hello gay world) and it sucks.\n\nSo yeah, that’s it.\nTl;dr flip fucked with my dad’s best friend for a week. No one else knows. I think I’ll tell my mom once my dad passes away lol, but that’s probably 20-30 years in the future. \n\n\nAnd yes, I’m aware this account barely has any activity and that’s because I’m a massive lurker. But hey, at least my username checks out! "

Intenté no reaccionar; no sé si fue descuido mío o de él, pero el teléfono quedó con la pantalla hacia arriba.

Mi cabeza empezó a hacer conexiones peligrosas. Guardé la nota en un sobre y no la toqué más hasta que pudiera pensar con calma.\n\nActualización 3 — Confrontación fallida y contradicciones:\nEsa noche intenté hablar con Andrés de nuevo. Le mostré el recibo y la nota sin dramatizar. Le pregunté directo: “¿Quién es Carla?”\nÉl respiró profundo y dijo que no sabía de qué hablaba; que si había algo era de su trabajo y que él no quería problemas.

No escuché nombres, pero no sonó como una conversación de trabajo.\n\nActualización 4 — Decisión y miedo:\nAhora estoy en un punto donde quiero pruebas, pero también tengo miedo de lo que pueda descubrir. Me pregunto si debo revisar más, confrontar con pruebas o esperar a ver si él vuelve a equivocarse. Mi corazón me grita que no me calle, pero la cabeza me pide calma.\n\nNo sé si Carla es la camarera, una compañera de trabajo o alguien más.

Once the initial setup was done, my daily workload shrank to some emails, occasional check-in meetings, and “urgent” requests.\n\nFor meetings, I barely pay attention. I recommend people to start using AI (fathom) to summarize and get action items. My 50-year-old director called me a “techie” for doing that.

The 19-year-old almost fell out of her chair laughing. She leaned over and whispered, “Thanks, Mom,” like she’d just been handed a lifetime supply of material to tease her roommate.\n\nI tried to fix it—“Oh—I mean sister? Roommate? Friend?” but the damage was done.\"—but it didn’t help. The younger one kept laughing, and the older one gave me a look sharp enough to cut through my scrubs.\n\nI kept the rest of the visit professional, but the whole time I was charting, I could hear the 19-year-old giggling under her breath, whispering “Thanks, Mom” every chance she got. When they finally left, the 20-year-old gave me this half-amused, half-dagger look that told me she might never forgive me.\n\nThat’s it. I confused a 20-year-old for her friend’s mother. I blame sleep deprivation, but the cringe is all mine."

At the end of the alley there was a 90° right turn which met the main street again...right beside the estate agents office. The owner had parked his pretty jaguar in the corner of the 90° turn. I touched the back drivers side door but instead of stopping i ploughed on, scratching and denting from the back door right up to the front panel. I thought best for me to get gone sharpish. I was more concerned with my parents car but turns out there wasnt a scratch. Anyone who knows that car will know the bumper sits quite high. In my defense, this estate agents preyed on young tenants and were well known to be awful so I feel like I provided his karma. "

    "text": "I work at a major grocery store in phoenix. As assistant manager it’s my job to check in deliveries. It all started with the dairy guy, and his young helper. He is a buff black man in his early 40’s and his helper was his 19 years old nephew. One day I asked how cold the back of the truck was. He said too cold for that thin shirt. I told him I could take it. They both immediately looked at my hard Nipples’s, I was wearing a thinner sports bra under a white button up. I pretended to be embarrassed and covered them. Then I started rubbing my tits to warm them up. He asked if I needed help. I said sure. He told the nephew to go, but I said he’s fine to watch. He started squeezing my natural D’s and breathed heavy. I don’t know what came over me but I unbuttoned my shirt and pulled my tits together. I said is that better? He pulled out my tit and started licking my nipple. I waived the nephew closer and started kissing him. I grabbed his hard cock and started squeezing. I yanked on his belt and he got the message. I jerked his big dick until uncle noticed. He started kissing me and took his dick out. I sat on a five gallon pail and started sucking the younger one’s cock. I figured he’d cum fast so I jerked and sucked deep. But he didn’t cum. I move on to the bigger dick and started sucking him off. After a few minutes I stood up and unzipped my pants. They both reached for my pussy at the same time. They were fingering me and rubbing my clit til I came. I then grabbed onto something and bent over. Soon a big dick was in me. I couldn’t tell who it was and felt like a slut. I came again. The other cock went in and the nephew jumped up on the thing I was holding onto. I sucked his dick until he came right in my mouth. The uncle grabbed my shoulder and spun me around, he pushed my head down so I could suck and swallow his cum to. I pulled up my pants and put my tits back in. Opened the door and said see you next week. I went to my office and closed the door to rub another one out. The saga continues. "

This femdom, she’s the only person I’ve opened up to about my trauma. I’m just afraid because I know in the end, even if she says she wants me forever. It’s never gonna develop beyond the spaces online. I won’t lie either I have a jealous heart now and I really need a real relationship. In my marriage I gave up so much of who I am. My heart burns for it. My heart dies to be taken and held, her hands feel safe holding my heart. But my mind screams at me, this will not be a happy ending for me. With my ex-wife I never felt safe sharing my deep deep emotions. This is the connection I have to this femdom. It’s gonna wreak me. I don’t know what to do, it’s just so hard to speak to anyone about it irl. She waits days between messaging me. I have poured my heart out to someone who will see me as disposable. As a toy. As a doll. I want to be held, I need it. The pain is so deep, but I am distraught at the fact that this is the person holding my heart. She tells me she loves me she encourages me to pursue my goals then she disappears for days. It’s so hard to let go of this. I am so lonely I work overnights and I’ve tried to talk to people irl, but I feel so vulnerable. Deep in my heart it hurts that I know she is a femdom to other people as well. I want someone who wants only me, but she messaged me first and keeps me strung along. I’ve asked her if she would want to be with my irl, I’ve asked if I could move past online. She always just skirts by my questions, doesn’t even acknowledge them. She says she wants to do things with me that I will feel her hands but I know she means imagination and not irl. It’s so so so hard to move past this. It’s like my heart is hearing the words I’ve yearned years to hear, but my mind knows the break will come."

She began small talk and started fanning herself as if she was hot, then proceeded to let her hair down and run her fingers through her hair. She asked where I was from, I told her, she said she just moved away from there two months ago. Small talk led to conversation that I was married and she had no relations. We talked for another half hour and then it was time to board. She said it was nice to have conversation and goodbye. I’m a married man, much older than her, but she certainly gave me signal that she was attracted. I was just like wow lady, you really left an impression and I didn’t even get your name. She boarded first, and when I got on the plane I saw her in a seat and something came over me that I would like to speak with her again. I reached in my wallet and gave her my business card, handed it to her and said “the next time you come to town, give me a call” her eyes lit up and her smile was back. She said “okay” and that was that. This was a first for me and have been on earth for a long time. I do hope that she reaches out again some day, I wish I knew her name.

Anyway, while I’m waiting for my food, this group of 7-8 teenagers is raising havoc in the store and bullying the ever-loving shit out of this poor woman working alone at the counter. I’m talking straight up screaming and cursing at her for no discernible reason over quite a long period of time, to the point where she was clearly holding back tears. I am not doing it justice by describing it, because i promise that anybody in the proximity of these people would get as angry as I got, if not angrier. I did something very stupid at this moment. I walked up to the main “perpetrator”, grabbed his shoulder firmly and told him that if he kept treating people like that, bad things would happen to him and he’d deserve it. Now that sounds like a threat in retrospect, but I never intended to start a conflict, only to warn him that others wouldn’t go through the effort of warning him. In response, he turns around and punches me in the mouth. At this point, I reflexively hit him back, twice (bad, I know, I should have left right then and there but I wasn’t thinking straight). At this point it turns into a full on brawl where hos friends try to grab me while he tries to tackle me to the ground. Obviously it doesn’t work because this is a very small, douchey kid who is not bery strong, but it results in his friends punching me from the side too. At this point I’ve stopped hitting them back and resorted to just defending myself because I’ve regained my senses and obviously I’m not going to beat up some kids who are like 3 to 4 years younger than me. It basically ended with me getting in my car after yelling at them for a bit about how this woman is a minimum wage worker who has done nothing to them, but now I just feel like an idiot for doing any of that, because not only did I strike someone much younger than me, but I also probably just made things worse for the girl working there if those kids ever decide to come back.

    "text": "This applies to almost everybody I work with and spend time with. I know them. I know their dispositions, how they talk, what's going on in their lives. I have some idea of the interpersonal relationships; the woman with the bangs doesn't get on very well with the short woman with curly light brown hair and glasses, and the tall man who always wears a hat is dating the blonde. The woman with really long and straight brown hair is a total control freak, but self-aware enough to not make it a huge deal. I know them. I just don't know their names.\n\nI know names from emails and stuff, I just absolutely cannot connect them to a face. Yesterday I exchanged a couple emails with Abby. This morning I ran into the brunette with the raspy voice, who's probably in my top ten closest friends. I'm about 80% sure they're the same person.\n\nLast week in a meeting I asked the woman with the dimples and bushy ponytail how to spell her name. I had to write it down and didn't want to admit I didn't know it. Her name is Emma. Do you know how many ways there are to spell Emma? Not many, I'll tell you that. I thought Emma was sitting across the table from me, but that was Chloe. I thought Chloe couldn't make it because the short brunette who usually wears cargo pants wasn't there. Still not sure who that is, but Chloe was totally there and looked exactly like I thought Emma looked. They look nothing alike.\n\nThe other day, I ran into someone I knew pretty well a few years ago, but haven't hung out with since. I knew exactly who they were: the person with the curly hair who opens their mouth really wide while talking. I waved and said \"hey dude, it's been a while!\" After a second, they recognized me and greeted me by name. We caught up for at least ten minutes. I'm pretty sure I knew their name at some point. I think it was one syllable, but that might have been a nickname.\n\nI used to teach. I could learn dozens of names within a couple days, when I was in charge of the people they were attached to. I could still list off some of my favorite (and least favorite) students. There were always a couple kids that it took me a bit longer to fully internalize, but I was proud of my name-learning abilities. I don't know what happened. I stopped teaching, and I stopped knowing people's names.\n\nJake and I have been collaborating a thing for a week or so, mostly by email. I was walking out with the balding guy with a goatee, chatting, and had a brainwave about it. I relayed it, convinced that he would know what I was talking about. That wasn't Jake. I think Jake is the balding skinny guy with a beard. I tried to convince whoever that was that I just had some wires crossed and was tired, but I'm not sure he bought it.\n\nI think people assume I don't gossip because it's unkind. I don't spread gossip because I have no idea how to tell middle-part that southern-accent and sparkly-mascara had an argument.\n\nI have two nieces who are twins, but look and act nothing alike. Redhead is the self-conscious one who craves attention, and blondie is the athletic one who fears failure. I know both of their names, but every time I see either of them it takes me at least fifteen minutes to remember which name goes to which person.\n\nI'm getting lunch with the man with the curly hair who laughs like a squirrel. I know his name is Chris because we've spent a *lot* of time together and I've heard people call him Chris many, many times. I feel like I can trust him. I could ask him if it's obvious, but what if it is? I'm very doubtful if I can change, to say nothing of how awkward and hurtful it would be to ask people I've worked with for so long what I'm supposed to call them."

    "text": "Long post alert, strap in (full on emotional cheating, guilt, maybe addiction?, and plenty of underlying issues…ik). I don’t need to be shamed so only comment or each out if you’ll be friendly. \n\nBackground: I’ve been with my partner for 10 years, since college. She’s been my first everything and me hers. We did long distance for a while and back together. We are now married very very recently. She’s an introvert and I extro. I love her but fundamentally we’re different. Not in areas that are important enough to end things. We’re a power couple: smart, passionate, families get along, great future and dynamic. We, at least from my side, lack that raw banter and chemistry. Through our the relationship I’ve found myself misunderstood, not stimulated intellectually and sexually. It’s fairly vanilla. She’s a perfect partner but I found my eyes widen when I had interactions when someone understood me. The banter with others got me gitty. During Covid lockdown times i discovered the NSFW side of Reddit and it opened something in me. Reading some confessions and stories made me crave more. Over time, I started posting and eventually chatting with people. First it was SFW but later became NSFW. Never in person, always online and discreet. My partner didn’t know and still doesn’t. \n\nEventually I had a connection what felt and still feels too good to be true. I felt alive again? She matched my humor but also my freak. We talked fairly often when I could find time and over time, developed into something pretty special. Again, nothing happened but def lots of butterflies. It felt like when I talked she really listened. Practically it wasn’t anything that could materialize but we both were so in sync, on the same page, and just felt so real. \n\nFor her I was single, and soon we parted ways and probs for the better. We drifted apart due to life and her finding a partner. Parting ways was very difficult. As I’ve never experienced a break up in my life, it’s what felt like one? It’s harder when the other person doesn’t do anything bad so you can just hate them outta anger and forget. Everything reminded me about her. I was obsessed and I think she changed my life. Changed me who I am as a person and my outlook on myself/life. (For the better) yes she had flaws and baggage and yes I do too but to each other we both complimented each other so well. The communication was soooooo good. I feel like I’m going on and on, but hopefully someone reading this understands that level of be on the same way with the opposite sex and each year attraction that brings. \n\nWhen we parted ways, we tried to stay in touch here and there and after a while of lengthy no replies, I deleted the app that we were chatting on. Very recently, I saw that she blocked me on Reddit. I can confirm she didn’t delete her account because my SFW account can see her account as active.  \n\nHere’s my biggest fear: I fear that she found me on social media and learned about my partner and life. She went off on me on the app that we were chatting on, deleted me and I came to Reddit and deleted me. I am very anxious about going back to check because I do not want to confront any of that. It sounds very avoidant because it is. I do not want to lose my image in her eyes. she thinks very highly of me and if my intuition is correct, having her say bad things about me will just make me feel worse. Sounds weird but I do not want to taint what her and I had. We promised to check in on each other from time to time and not be strangers.  \n\nI kinda just wanna talk to someone logical about this. I know a lot of this seems for sounds like not a big deal and I don’t want to be dismissed. But any advice, opinions, thoughts, and just comforting, therapeutical guidance would be helpful from someone who has experienced something similar or someone who’s an empath. \n\nI’ve been apart from that and it has been good and my relationship has been doing well but given me a restless feeling of wanting to know what she’s up to. How she is and what’s going on in her life. \n\nI know being away is the right thing to do. But idk what to do about check in. Maybe it’s adult thing to do to face the truth and get closure about her finding out the truth and getting mad at me. Or maybe I’m overthinking? Idk "

    "text": "I realise this issue is very specific to me and can already see the wave of down votes for this coming but here goes:\n\nWhen my mum got cheated on by my dad, she ended up re marrying someone who ended up being a complete sociopath.  He loved and I mean LOVED knowing that he upset people he disliked. But to be honest it took barely anything for him to dislike people. And with me, he'd have nothing to be mad at me for, but essentially thought I was just devil spawn purely for being related to my cheating dad. On one occasion he practically said so: me, my mum and him were eating in public and I just mentioned my dad in passing for a random reason and he instantly started having a go at ME and getting angry at ME because of my dad's actions. I honestly have never wanted to die on the spot more than I did at that moment. And my mum just sat there and said nothing as people eating near us looked over at me.\n\nOn top of that he would just get angry at us (me and my brothers) for small domestic matters that were never a problem before he came on the scene. And my mum would either not argue with him or would actively encourage his shitty behaviour.\n\nBasically when it came to me and him, I was always the last person to be thought of. As in: his wants and demands were always top priority and mine didn't really matter. And my mum was cool with it.\n\nThis continued on right up until they got divorced. And on that note, something else that was really shitty was that my now ex stepdad made the request that my mum never talk to me or my brothers again, on top of the request that our dog be given to a shelter. The thing about this that really stabs me in the heart is that my mum said the driving factor behind her eventual divorce was the fact of our dog being rehomed, not potentially disowning me. And whats more: they were discussing getting divorced for like A YEAR. For a year my mum was seriously considering not seeing me and my brothers again. I understand that people get lonely but the fact that she was even considering this guy given the context is the biggest stab in the heart. And all because she was so weak that she couldn't turn away from him.\n\nSo what I have to say is this: I have sympathy for women being treated unfairly and think that they do face a lot of crap. Heck, me and my old friend group would literally choose the club we'd go to based off of the least likely one to spike the girls' drinks. That shouldn't happen, period. BUT... if women are getting manipulated by guys, it's their responsibility to cut things off. Nobody else's. Nobody should have to talk common sense into any woman to do that. Essentially what I'm saying is that I have no sympathy for women who are with shitty partners and are doing nothing about it. It doesn't matter if its not your fault because it 100% is your problem. And in my case it wasn't just my mum's problem but also mine by extension. She could have told this guy to straighten up and fly right and she instead chose the more comfortable (for her) option of burying her head in the sand and ignoring the red flags, basically putting my mental health on the chopping block.\n\nSo there you have it, hopefully nobody sees this as some sort of supervillain origin story, lol."

I've never told anyone about it, and I've been keeping it a secret for over a year now. \n\nI'll try to keep as much information as possible to myself. I don't want my loved ones to find out what I've done, but if I don't say it out loud, I don't think I'll ever come to terms with the situation. \n\nOver a year ago, I met this girl, and she was incredible. She was the most beautiful woman I had ever met in my life, and even today, I still think about her from time to time. \n\nAt a party, I got close to her, and one thing led to another. She was part of my life for several months, and I've never been happier than during those moments.\n\nUnfortunately, given our life plans, our paths painfully diverged, and it took me a long time to get over it. \n\nOne night, I was driving home after work when I had a car accident. It took me a long time to recover and regain full mobility. \n\nThen one morning, without me understanding why, she was standing at my door, her eyes full of tears and concern. She spent the next few days taking care of me, helping me take my medication and apply my cream (she is a nurse, and it was this cream that she brought me that literally saved my arm, even today).\n\nI knew she had serious family problems; we had discussed them at length, and I had confided a lot about my own family to her. One evening, as we lay in my bed after spending some time together, she told me that she no longer wanted to be on this earth, and that she had been terrified of losing me on the day of my accident.\n\nAt that moment, I finally saw red. I couldn't believe she could say something like that so naturally. For my part, there was always this attraction between us, this kind of osmosis that I considered essential in my life. Hearing her say that she no longer wanted to be in this world tore my heart apart. Despite everything, I could understand her feelings, even though I didn't agree with the idea.\n\nWithout realizing it, I ended up putting my hands around her neck and gently squeezing. She didn't even try to stop me, as if a silent agreement had been made between us. I could feel her heart beating between my fingers and her breath leaving her lungs little by little, while her mind did not struggle.\n\nMy head was completely empty when I did it, as if my subconscious had agreed to let the anger that was buried inside me speak.\n\nAfter a few seconds, I finally removed my hands, and it took three seconds before she caught her breath. I was furious to realize that she wanted to leave, and I blamed myself for helping her.  \n\nAfter that, I took her in my arms and calmed her down until she could breathe again. She didn't say anything, but I suspected she was silently asking herself, \"Why did you stop?\" \n\nInstinctively, I said to her, \"I'll choose the moment myself, but in the meantime, I forbid you to die,\" before hiding a tear.\n\nSince that day, she is no longer part of my life and is successfully continuing her nursing studies, while I have completely changed my own life.\n\nI hope that this experience has allowed us to grow, and I hope that I have had a \"positive\" impact on her life.\n\nNo one knows and no one will ever know that I almost killed her of my own accord. I am the monster hiding among men. \n\nSometimes I feel the pulse in her neck between my fingers and I often ask myself:\n\nWhat would have happened if I had continued?\n"

There was a curtain over a glass window where everyone could peek out into my room when they wanted . I had no access to the toilet at night time . I wasn't allowed into the main house a lot of the time and most of my food was brought out to me in this room.  It was awful.  She said it was because I kept slamming door of my old bedroom I wonder what she would think if she knew her foster son was molesting all 3 of her foster daughters. \nAbsolutely traumatic childhood lol anyone else ?"

Well, I went to the dentist and they actually said they can save all but 2 of my teeth. It’s the 2 that are so painful right now. But, jokes on me because I have fucked up roots. They can’t extract those with the roots being twisted so I have a referral to an oral surgeon. Can’t get in there until October 30th. Idk how I’m going to last that long. Mentally, I’m broken. Physically, I’m hurting. I can’t eat. Can’t sleep. I’ve lost 18lbs in the last 2 months. \n\nIf anyone has any kind of advice or help, I would more than grateful to hear it.

Aparentemente yo también le gusto y a lo que me dice está igual de enamorado de mi como yo lo estoy de el.\nEl tema es que desde hace dos semanas que estamos hablando más me ha ofrecido tomar estupefacientes, a lo cual yo he accedido, las cosas se ponen calientes y nos hemos besado y tocado, pero no más, no por debajo de la ropa ni siquiera.\nEl insiste en tener relaciones, de hecho apenas me dijo que lo acompañara a un lugar, como empezamos a ir de que a entregar cosas, accedí, pero me llevó a un motel. Le mentí diciendo que estaba menstruando, que no podía pero no le importo, me sentí muy mal y lloré y no hicimos nada estando en el hotel, más hablar, besarnos un poco y ya. El me dejó de hablar, lo busqué y seguimos hablando ahora, el me invitó a su casa el día de ayer, me dio unas flores cuando nos vimos, no había nadie en su casa y empezaron a pasar cosas, pero nuevamente no me sentí lista, me dijo que no me preocupara, que nos metiéramos un ajo. \nTomamos un poco de alcohol y me quedé dormida. \nDesperté en su cama con ropa interior de él en lugar de la mía, y el estaba como si nada.\nCuando le pregunté sobre lo ocurrido me dijo que me habia orinado, puedo jurar que yo nunca me he orinado ni en mis peores momentos. Cuando le pedí mi ropa me dijo que estaba secándose.\nNo sentí nada raro, ni dolor ahí abajo, pero casi asegurar que nada pasó.\nDespués de que eso pasó me estaba abranzando y diciendo lo mucho que me amaba.\nPara este punto quiero decir que he estado de migajers todos los días preguntándole o mandando indirecta de novios, el solo me dice que si pero no tiene la iniciativa. Pero las flores y ciertas acciones me hacen pensar que realmente le interesó.\n¿Ustedes que piensan?"

It’s nothing glamorous, just a cozy place where people come in for their daily caffeine fix, and I’ve been there long enough to recognize most of the regulars by sight.\n\nAbout six months ago, this one person started coming in almost every morning. They always ordered the same thing—a medium cappuccino, sometimes with a croissant if they looked extra tired. They never really said much, just smiled politely and tipped well.\n\nOne morning, their card got declined. They looked so embarrassed, muttered something about transferring money later, and started to leave. I don’t even know why, but I told them, “It’s fine, just take it.” They looked so relieved, thanked me like I’d just saved their life, and left.\n\nThe next day they came back, trying to pay me double, and I just waved it off. It kind of became a habit after that. Sometimes they’d pay, sometimes I’d “forget” to charge them. It felt good. It wasn’t about flirting or anything, I just liked seeing them relax a little. Like, life is hard enough, and a free coffee isn’t going to bankrupt the shop.\n\nHere’s the part I’m ashamed of: I never learned their name. Not once. For six months, I’ve been handing this stranger free coffee, having small talk about the weather, nodding when they tell me about their long work shifts… and I still don’t know what they’re called. It’s way past the point where I can just casually ask.\n\nLast week, they stopped coming. I don’t know if they moved away, changed jobs, or just found another café. I didn’t realize how attached I’d gotten until the routine broke. Now every morning feels weirdly empty, and I keep catching myself looking at the door.\n\nI keep thinking about how I’ll never even know their name, and how I basically just… gave free coffee to a ghost who disappeared.\n\nI don’t regret it, but I do feel stupid for never making it more than small talk."

    "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1nekcnr/i_21m_followed_a_random_girl_at_night_5_years_ago/",
    "text": "First off, I get how psycho this sounds and I don't want to come here pretending I have any excuses for my behaviour, nor any idea to this day why I ~~thought this was a good idea~~ even considered doing such a thing, as it is absolutely despicable. Now I'm 21, almost 5 years later, and I just want to come clean. My GF knows too, as I told her all about this recently.\n\n\n\nWhen I was 16, I was caught quite lonely mid-pandemic (when the restrictions weren't high), with nobody to hang out, so I got this habit of wandering the streets of my home town, mostly during the dark. I had social anxiety, so the pandemic masks combined with a hoodie and the dark helped me not get noticed by any acquaintances from high school. The walks happened once every 2 days, sometimes even daily, mostly when I felt like I've spent too much time with my family enclosed within 4 walls. When doing so, I usually played some music in my earphones, mostly The Weeknd, as that was my favourite artist at the time and spent the time thinking about every day stuff, imagining scenarios, fantasising crushes, normal teenager stuff until now. 8 months before this incident, The Weeknd released the album After Hours, which features In Your Eyes, a song with a video where The Weeknd himself is caught in a purgatory stalking and following his ex around the town, all until the end of the video where she finally kills him.\n\n\n\nNow that the exposition is done, let's get into the facts. The night of the incident, 4th of January, I again wandered aimlessly around the few streets I knew in my town, playing Weeknd's album, when suddenly In Your Eyes is in rotation, and sequences of it's video flash into my mind, making this girl in front of me to catch my attention. She was blonde, dressed casually for winter and simply walking her dog. So an idea spawns in my mind: what would it be like to follow her around, just to see how far I can go and what could happen? \n\n\n\nIn my defense, even though nothing could change how cruel this was already, I didn't intend to do this to harm her, abuse her, rape her or anything like that. I was just curious how it feels like, I was bored and wanted to reenact what The Weeknd does in the video, to feel some thrill, to rebel against goodness, I don't really know, even though she clearly couldn't know all this. With that in mind, I lower my pace and start walking behind her, around 5 meters / 15 feet behind. It went as I wished. At one point, I wanted to not be predictable and got the idea to take another path, to make her get the impression that she isn't followed anymore, just to follow her again 2 blocks later, and it worked. Once again, I was behind her. Maybe 2 minutes later, we get on a more public street, but I'm still behind her, until one point when she stopped to let her dog smell some tree. Not wanting to lose her, I stop behind her too, pretending to watch something on my phone. When she started walking again I did too, before getting stopped shortly after by a man who got out of some car in the parking lot left of me. He came to me and quickly asked me if I was ok, and I said yes, to which he responded with \"young man, sure you're ok?\", to which I said yes again, only for him to tell me \"go home!\". By this point I realised what all this looked like and hoped to get out of there before getting beaten up (like The Weeknd got too in his Blinding Lights video). After that, I went to buy some soda, drank the whole bottle so quick that I almost puked up all for no reason whatsoever and then went home. It's not until a few days later I fully realised that could've gotten me in big trouble, not to mention how awful it was for the poor girl.\n\n\n\nI am sorry for what I did. I wasn't aware at all what harm I might've done. If I could meet her, I would tell her how sorry I am, even though that would probably be pretty scary for her if she'd recognise me. I really hope she didn't notice me at all behind her and it was just that man that figured out what I wanted to do, but the damage is, sadly, already done and I can't go back to undo it. That was an isolated event, I didn't do anything like that ever again and now that I have a GF that I fiercely protect for some time now I just realise how creepy, scary and down right stupid I was. I'm not gonna blame anyone but myself for that.\n\n\n\nThank you for listening my confession and sorry if there are any mistakes (English isn't my first language)."

But still we liked eachother so much. \n\nBut now it's been 3 years since my sister has passed away. Thinking about my past actions is making me feel awful. I should have been more good to her. People have heard elder siblings bullying the younger ones. But here it was the opposite. Thinking about all those moments makes me so much regretful and I'm feeling so bad. I can't even say sorry to her now anymore. I don't know what to do. It's so much hurting inside."

    "text": "Several years ago, my daughter had just come home from college for the summer and parked her car on the street in front of our house. That same night, a drunk driver hit her parked car so hard that it was pushed about 50 feet back into our yard. He fled the scene, but thanks to our cameras and a helpful neighbor who turned him in since they had been drinking at their house, we were able to identify him.\n\nThe insurance company totaled her car and gave us $10,000 for it. It was a late model Honda. We used the payout to help her put a down payment on another car. About a month later, we got another deposit for the same amount from the insurance company. We decided not to say anything about the mix-up to the company and held onto the money for a year. After a year of not hearing anything from them, and our case being closed, we used all of it to help pay towards my daughter’s education. Never heard a thing.\n\nFast forward several years later now, she has since graduated with her master’s degree and now helps children with autism develop fine motor and coping skills. She still has some loan debt but it is 10k less than what it would have been.\n\nI’ve always wondered how that double payment happened, but I’m glad it did. It was a huge help for us and for my daughter, who also worked full-time to help pay for her education.\n\nEdited for Grammar and wording"

Unfortnately, when exams came around, she gave it her all but in the end, she only got one A. I told her she did a good job and I was proud of her effort, but that she didn’t quite meet the promise we had made. She was clearly disappointed and frustrated, I it was all over her face.\n\nSo, I decided to do something a little fun. I handed her a soda with a promo on it and told her to try her luck entering a prize draw. Meanwhile, I went to ahead and bought the scooter anyway and arranged for someone else to deliver it to her. She went to pick it up thinking she’d actually won it from the contest. She was so excited and truly believed she’d earned it that way. And honestly, in my heart, I felt she had earned it with all the effort. Now, I’ve promised her a vacation if she hits the mark next time. I'm really hoping she nails it."

V has been married to her childhood sweetheart for the last four years, P got married two years ago, and my husband and I got married one year ago. I am currently four months pregnant.\n\nP gave birth about two weeks ago and she and her husband decided to have a baby welcoming and naming ceremony. V and I were very excited and brought a lot of gifts. It was her first baby after all. Her son was a cutie and I was glad to see P was doing well since the birth was a little hard on her. Then the naming ceremony started and the name reveal did not go as I expected.\n\nThe name of her son was Yuen and as soon as I heard it, my heart stopped. Even V was shocked.\n\nFor context, I have always loved Chinese culture. I lived in China from ages seven to ten and visited many times as an adult. I also met my husband there. When I was four, my birth name was changed to something else and this is a important detail. The main thing is I fell in love with the name Yuen. It reminded me so much of my first name because they had similar meanings. I always, and I mean always, wanted to give that name to my son if I had one. After a while, I even started seeing a little boy with that name in my dreams, it felt like destiny. P and V knew this. They always knew how much I loved the name.\n\nI felt heartbroken. V tried to say something but I did not even hear it. P came up to us, all smiles and laughs as if she had not just taken something from me.\n\nShe told me, \"Hey X, I know, I know, you must be thinking I am a bad friend but you have to understand. Ever since you told me about that, I really loved it and I could not let the opportunity go since you do not have a kid still. Besides, my husband is Vietnamese, so the name at least fits our culture.\"\n\nI stared at her for a good ten minutes before I almost snapped. I said, \"You knew how much I loved that name ever since I was a young girl. Why? Why did you do this to me?\"\n\nHer reply stunned me. She told me that I was always unserious about having children, and even though I am now pregnant, she got pregnant first and deserved the name more.\n\nI could not believe this was my best friend of ten years saying that to me.\n\nShe finished with, \"You can name your son that, that is, if you have one, but you will be copying me. Think of what people will say about our kids. In our circle, it will be bad.\"\n\nI told her that they will not say anything about our kids because we simply will not be friends anymore, and I left.\n\nI went home and cried. I have always been serious about being a mother. I even wrote letters thinking of my future kids. Hearing what she said broke me. My husband was just as upset. We had even started setting up a nursery for Yuen since we found out we were having a boy. (And yes P knew that we were going with yuen!)\n\nTo top it off, P called me many times. I did not pick up. She started texting me, calling me a bitch and an asshole for ruining her son's party.\n\nI could tell people were watching when we argued, but I had no intention of ruining her son's first party. According to her and her mother, who texted me colorful words afterward, I ruined it.\n\nI feel hurt, she's one of my oldest friends and she does this to me?\n\nWhatever happens, I will not change my son's name, that's for sure."

Me celaba por todo y cada vez que discutíamos se ponía agresivo.\n\nUna noche llegó a un extremo que nunca voy a olvidar: me agarró de los pelos y me amenazó con un arma. Yo estaba temblando, asustada, sin saber qué hacer. Me encerré en el baño, llorando, sintiendo que estaba atrapada. En ese momento desesperado, agarré el teléfono y llamé a mi ex, el mismo que se drogaba, porque no sabía a quién más acudir.\n\nÉl apareció enseguida con un grupo de amigos.

La tensión era insoportable: gritos, amenazas, los otros empujando para entrar. Hasta llegaron a sacar machetes frente a su casa. Fue una escena de locura, como si estuviera en medio de una película violenta, pero era mi vida real.\n\nAl final logré salir, con el corazón latiéndome a mil y con la sensación de haber tocado fondo en ese momento.

The chaos goblin in my head would say, \"Take something.\" There were no cameras, no one was ever around, it would have been so easy. I started to get worried that I, a 40-year-old mother, was going to actually steal from this person. I struggle with impulse control. Finally I figured out the solution: introduce chaos and get the sweet dopamine by leaving things there instead. Obviously I have my own extensive collection of random objects I have impulse-bought over the years, so I grabbed a few that fit the aesthetic and put them in my purse. The first time it was a small frog and a carved resin rose. I set them on the table and scurried home. A few days later, I passed by again and they were moved! The frog was on a toadstool, and the rose was in a shrub. \n\nOver a few months I left more gifts now and then. They would be arranged nicely when I saw them again, but I started to get worried that I might be creeping the person out. And I am really nosy and I wanted to know who they were. I didn't want to just knock on the door and confess, so I devised a plan. In my town, a group of people will paint small rocks, then leave them to be found in random places. There is a message on the back with the Facebook page of the group. People who find a rock will post where they found it, then leave it somewhere for the next person. I had one such rock in my possession. I left the rock on the table and then waited, stalking the Facebook page. To my delight, the rock appeared after a few weeks! My neighbor was happy, inspired to start painting her own rocks, and seemed to be a kindred spirit, as suspected. I snooped on her Facebook profile enough to feel like she probably wasn't worried that her secret gifter was a stalker ex or something, but I didn't try to friend her or anything like that. \n\nI continued to leave things occasionally, but we ended up moving a few months later. I did leave a note at that point explaining a little of who I was, but not that I was planning crimes originally, and then stalking her on social media. I just didn't want her to wonder about it forever. "

I don't feel, I just do whatever creates the most beneficial outcome for myself. I don't focus on the people, I focus on the objective and the outcome.\n\n     But I don't like it. I feel mechanical, like a robot programmed to do my day-to-day tasks. And I don't want to end up hurting someone because of that. But I also don't want to go back. Because all that ends up happening is me feeling hurt again. So it's just this endless cycle of emotions, no emotions, then emotions, then no emotions. \n\n     I don't know if I need help or if this is a common thing or what. I don't know what it is, it feels like a trauma response, but I can do it manually or it just happens. Either way, I don't like it, but I also don't want it gone. It keeps me from feeling hurt, but it also keeps me from everything else as well. I don't know, so I just have to live with it. \n\nThat's all, goodbye"

That doesn’t mean I don’t have conventionally attractive friends too tho, I do but for some reason I cannot make friends with people who are TOO conventionally attractive.\n\nI know this girl who literally looks like an angel on earth.

Plus she’s also super smart and has an angelic singing voice. I swear she’s like Madison Beer. For some reason even though i’ve known her since freshman year through my other friends I cannot bring myself to get close to her because I genuinely get nervous talking to someone so perfect. I can barely look her in the eye and keep eye contact. I don’t know if I’m jealous or what but I cannot keep up a conversation with this girl unless other people are there. And I know it’s not a matter of we have nothing to talk about, it’s more that I literally get lost at words trying to talk to her because I cannot stop noticing how pretty, social and charismatic she is. I’m also afraid of her judgement. She’s literally so confident and intelligent in every aspect and I feel like if I say one thing she’ll judge me which I know doesn’t make sense but I swear it just feels like that talking to pretty people.\n\nShe also has a twin sister but for some reason I feel comfortable talking to her 😂 "

His gaze lingered on me, his eyes filled with an insatiable hunger that made my heart race. I was dressed in a traditional saree for our office's traditional day, and I could see him struggling to keep his eyes off me.\n\n\"Pranali, you look stunning today,\" Aman said, his voice low and husky. \"That saree... it's doing things to me.\" I could see the effect I was having on him, and it thrilled me. I decided to tease him a little.\n\n\"Why, Aman, are you checking me out?\" I asked, a playful smile on my lips. \"Is there something about my saree that you find particularly... interesting?\" I knew exactly what it was. The way the saree draped over my body, revealing just enough to tantalize, and the way it framed my armpits, which I knew he had a particular fondness for.\n\nAman's eyes darkened with desire. \"You know exactly what I'm talking about, Pranali,\" he said, his voice rough. \"I can't stop thinking about you... about what I want to do to you.\"\n\nI felt a shiver run down my spine at his words. \"And what is it that you want to do to me, Aman?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, my breath coming in shallow gasps.\n\nAman leaned in closer, his lips brushing against my ear. \"I want to kiss you, Pranali,\" he said, his breath hot against my skin. \"I want to taste every inch of your body... I want to make you moan my name.\"\n\nI felt my knees go weak at his words. \"Aman, we can't... not here,\" I protested weakly, even as I felt my body responding to his words.\n\n\"Then let's go somewhere else,\" Aman said, his eyes never leaving mine. \"Somewhere private... where we can do whatever we want.\"\n\nI hesitated for a moment, but the desire in his eyes was too much to resist. I nodded, and Aman took my hand, leading me out of the office and into the elevator. The moment the doors closed, he was on me, his lips crashing against mine in a passionate kiss.\n\nWe stumbled out of the elevator, our hands roaming each other's bodies, our breaths coming in ragged gasps. Aman pushed me up against the wall, his hands gripping my hips as he ground his erection against me.\n\n\"I want you, Pranali,\" he growled, his voice thick with desire. \"I want to feel you wrapped around my dick... I want to make you scream my name.\"\n\nI moaned in response, my body aching for him. \"Then take me, Aman,\" I said, my voice trembling with desire. \"I'm yours... do whatever you want with me.\"\n\nAman's eyes darkened with lust, and he lifted me up, my legs wrapping around his waist as he carried me into a nearby conference room. He kicked the door shut behind us, his lips never leaving mine as he laid me down on the table.\n\nHe tore off my saree, his eyes darkening with desire as he took in my naked body. \"Fuck, Pranali,\" he groaned, his hands roaming over my breasts, my hips, my thighs. \"You're so fucking beautiful.\"\n\nI reached for him, pulling him towards me, my lips meeting his in a searing kiss. I could feel his erection pressing against me, and I moaned into his mouth, my hips arching up to meet his.\n\nAman broke the kiss, his lips trailing down my neck, my breasts, my stomach. He reached the apex of my thighs, and I gasped as his tongue flicked out, teasing my clit.\n\n\"Oh, fuck, Aman,\" I moaned, my hands gripping his hair as he licked and sucked at my pussy. \"That feels so fucking good.\"\n\nAman groaned in response, his tongue working me into a frenzy.

He thrust into me, his dick filling me up, stretching me to the limits. I cried out in pleasure, my body trembling with need.\n"

    "text": "I SA’d three different girls from the ages 12-14 without realizing what I was doing was SA.\n\n( Can I talk to my therapist about this?)\n\nOk. It’s time I get this off my chest. I saw another person post about their situation similar to this, and it gave me the confidence to share my own story. I’ll give some background on my mental health and childhood experiences before explaining the incidents with three girls that still weigh heavily on me.\nWhen I was about six years old, I was exposed to pornography by a childhood friend. \n\nLooking back, I think it deeply affected me. From a young age, I had intrusive sexual thoughts about teachers or classmates that I didn’t fully understand. I was never really aroused, but those thoughts lingered constantly. Now, I’m a senior in high school, trying to piece together how all of this shaped me.\nIn elementary school, I had a reputation as a funny, athletic kid with lots of friends. I also often had girlfriends but developed a troubling fixation on sexual behaviors far too early. I learned toxic behavior from a friend who was disrespectful toward women, and I mimicked some of it. For example, when my brother told me about a girl bullying him, I smacked her in the head because I thought that’s how you “put girls in their place.” I regret this and know now it was wrong.\n\nMiddle school is when things really went downhill. Puberty hit, I developed a porn addiction, and though I had friends and social standing, I also treated some girls badly by name-calling or reacting aggressively ( not physically just verbally with lots of passive aggressive behavior) if they upset me. Later on I learned from a friend that Many of those girls remembered those things and  I didn’t, because I was acting so impulsively and without thought it was like a second nature to me that I thought was ok and it definitely wasn’t.\nBy seventh grade, I’d had my first physically intimate (but consensual) relationship with a girlfriend during summer school. Surprisingly I didn’t do any of the things that you would think I would’ve done leading up to this relationship somehow when it comes to certain girls, I’m actually capable of courting them, talking to them, building an actual connection and getting chemistry before I properly ask them to be in a official relationship. \n\n(again for more context I know because I’m rushing and kind of skimming over things and every little detail in my middle school years you guys might think I’m just this weird creep dude who’s only thinking about being physically intimate with girls and I’m not for the most part throughout my entire life and almost every aspect of my social life I have done very well. I don’t wanna say very well like it’s a struggle for me. I am naturally a good person plain as day. I build connections. I’m nice and I have friends all and basically the normal things that kids usually do. It’s just I don’t know what happened with me to wear these few three times I just made all the wrong decisions that have definitively defined my past.) (i’m gonna say this a lot or a couple of times throughout this story or text. I don’t know what’s was wrong with me like I said these things happened quite some time ago and around the times that they happened. I didn’t know that what I was doing was  SA. that’s the best way I’ve been able to put a wrap. \n\nMy thoughts around it is nowhere before or after or even leading up to that point in my life I had a consistent pattern of doing those things to anybody else. What I’m trying to say is that is not something I’m into that is something I’ve always known was wrong that I’ve been taught not to do by my parents, I don’t think about doing those things on a day-to-day basis. It’s not something I make a hobby of I secretly want to do. Because when I’m sitting here thinking about these moments because I do I do a lot when I’m sitting in my bed at night or even when I’m just moving throughout the day or i’m at school walking to class talking with friends at some point in time these thoughts come back into my mind and I’m just filled with dread and sadness and disappointment in myself because I always try to think. What was I thinking in that moment, what did I think of before that incident? What train of thought did I have what cues or body language did? I think I was reading to where I somehow came to the conclusion that that specific course of action was acceptable. \n\nThat is what plays my mind most when I think about those incidents that happened in my past is, what was I thinking. And how could I possibly ever think that doing that was OK. In any context how can I possibly think that what I did was OK. I mean obviously majority of what my rationalization I’m guessing was that I thought each and everyone of those girls like me, which two of them actually confirmed themselves that they did like me the other one  I was assuming. Like I said, I don’t understand it, no one in my family would ever even suspect or think I could do anything like that because of who I am naturally, and what hurts me the most is how after I did them I just went on with my day and I ended up being more upset at the people. I did it too than myself for doing it. \n\nThe second girl I wasn’t upset at like I said I realize what I did was wrong and I apologize immediately that time I was mad at myself I was sad but I guess when she told me she forgave me and that it was OK I really Just took her words to heart and immediately I forgot about it. But you would just have to meet me and have known me my whole life to know that like this isn’t who I am at heart if I had realized what I had done back then I’m pretty sure I would’ve felt the same way I do now But sadly back then in my head I couldn’t see what I did was wrong and the effects that that has had on myself are detrimental and the effects that they have on those other people are unforgivable. Also, like I said some I’m I’m going off the top of my head here in one constant flow, some other context I forgot to give is that was my last actual relationship was in seventh grade and since then I have not had any two real relationships, but there have been two girls who also liked me and we were in a mutually consenting physical relationship. Just not an official one. Now back to the real story) After that ended, I became desperate to feel that connection again. That’s when the first incident happened.\n\nGirl 1 (middle school):  \nI misread a classmate’s friendliness and thought she liked me. (When I mean, I thought you liked me, I don’t mean we had one conversation when she was nice to me and I immediately took that and ran with it. I mean, when I had realized I had a crush on this girl, I started talking to her getting closer with her. I eventually got her number and it was nothing but good vibes on all of our text. However, some of the things I picked up that I thought were signs that she was flirting with me, which when I hear it now obviously it’s stupid and I was Making a dumb narratives in my head following my hormones. I remember she would always tell me personal things that I I thought you wouldn’t really just tell anybody else like how she was having intimate relations with this one basketball player in San Francisco. Somehow, I rationalize that too she liked me and that it was a hint. Another thing that I used as some rationalization again passed me. \nI’m not trying to advocate or support this now in the present in anyway at all. \n\nI’m just saying from what I can remember. I think one of the other things I used as rationalization was this guy who she was Somehow close with it was weird leach kind of relationship because like I said now I realize she has very severe social anxiety because this guy who she was always attached to she would follow around at school all the time, which a lot of of us from our friend group back then that was kind of weird, but I didn’t never realize it was social anxiety because that was the only guy from her elementary school that she knew. And I mean she would follow him around. She would quite literally just follow him around everywhere and he never even talk to her matter fact for the most part, he didn’t even like her. And I remember if she had did one thing to piss him off a week before and I asked him one week I forgot what the specific question I asked him.\n \nI just remember him telling me that she was a hoe and yada yada yada stuff after that it goes blank after that memory. \nWhich I’m guessing in my 12-year-old mind I thought that meant any move I make will go in especially if she likes me so because I was desperate to chase that feeling again of physical touch, I decided to start touching her thighs. Which obviously we now know was a very terrible thing to do and the absolute wrong choice to make .) One day, I inappropriately touched her thigh and waist. Like the social anxiety I mentioned before She laughed nervously and ran, and I misinterpreted this as playful. I interpreted that as playful because that was really how she always acted with me and everybody else but because in my mind, I thought she liked me. I thought she was being playful. Because there was nothing really different in her tone or Voice compared to how she always talked she would always happy smiling and giggling at the slightest thing. And beforehand I’ve been rejected by girls before and I was never really exposed to that kind of rejection most girls would just laugh in my face. Make fun of me or mock me anytime I tried to ask them out.  \n\nLater that day  I learned from a she had cried afterward. And when I heard that I was mostly confused I wasn’t sad. I didn’t realize what I’ve done. I just remember feeling confused. I felt a little bad because I never meant to make her cry, but I was mostly confused because I thought this was a girl that liked me.   One day way later it hit me that she  was scared not flirting and that’s how she expressed it she would just laugh it off. I learned this Years later, when people said she told others what happened, it hit me fully that I had assaulted her. I was horrified with myself. \n\nBut too scared to come out about it so I started lying. It was selfish but I was scared and didn’t know what to do and this was around a depressing period of my life where I was really desperate for friends and I didn’t wanna lose a few friends. I still had left so I lied to them telling them that she was making things up and I think they ended up believing me. I always feel bad about what I did, but I never really had the chance to apologize because we had just got back from distant learning and while some of us went back to campus lots of others stayed online and she was one of them. And this was around eighth grade, which was my last year at that school because I transferred to a different school for high school.. ( Other stayed because that school went from 6th - 12th)\nGirl 2 (family friend):  \n\nWhen I was about 13 or 14, a girl who visited my house admitted she liked me. We were close, and one night in the hot tub I touched her intimately—this time with her consent. But months later, when she came over again, she avoided my advances. Instead of respecting that fully, I kept pushing for opportunities to get physical until I frustrated her. Looking back, I realize how predatory and selfish my behavior was, and I still feel ashamed.\n\nGirl 3 (high school):  \nIn ninth grade, another girl told me she liked me. At first I said I didn’t feel the same. Later, when I was craving affection, I convinced myself she still had feelings for me. During class, I touched her thigh without first asking. When she distanced herself afterward and told me she no longer liked me, I realized how wrong I’d been. I apologized.\n\nSince then, I’ve reflected constantly on my actions. Almost every girl from middle school disliked me, and I couldn’t figure out why until I finally realized later  that my actions toward Girl 1 were sexual assault. I feel disgusted when I think of the hurt I caused.\n\nI live with guilt knowing I harmed people who didn’t deserve it. I want to apologize sincerely to all of them, but I’m conflicted. Part of me fears reaching out—they might reject me, expose me publicly, or even retaliate. Another part of me wants to face them honestly, accept the consequences, and prove that I’ve changed. I might atone for what I’ve done or pay for what I’ve done and like a coward I’m too scared to find out which it might be. \nNow, as graduation approaches, I see two paths:\n\nTake the risk of reaching out, apologizing sincerely, and trying to atone—knowing it could ruin me socially and with my family.\n\n\nStart fresh quietly, moving away and rebuilding life differently, while carrying the guilt.\n\nI don’t expect forgiveness. I just want to acknowledge the harm I caused, take responsibility, and live as someone better than who I used to be.\n\nI’ve thought about talking to my old therapist about this and start rescheduling some appointments with her, but I’m afraid she might tell my mom and I don’t want my entire family to turn against me because I’m not that person anymore and then where I never was I just made bad decisions With a terrible mindset that I’ve had lasting negative effects. But I want to know can I talk to my therapist about this?"

I'm an economist (even though I never liked the degree) and I work in investment monitoring. I can't tell you how incredibly boring and unpleasant I find it, but they pay well, and with that I can buy things for my parents and pay the bills. \n\nI'm always tired. I'm so stressed because, in reality, my job has no \"quitting time.\" My boss can call on weekends or outside of office hours. I live in constant anxiety. And even though I always try hard to draw and improve (so I can get a job in the animation industry), it never seems to be enough. I'm useless, I always make mistakes at work, sometimes even with basic sums or filters or Excel formulas. The worst thing is, what can I do if I'm an idiot? That doesn't get better by studying more. I'll always forget things, overlook others, which will affect my team and embarrass me.\n\nBut of course, they pay well... I think."

    "text": "What is your worst memory as a kid?\n\nMaybe your father drinking a bit too much Don Julio and crapping his pants? Or maybe it was the day you got into a fight at school and lost in front of everybody. Maybe you thought you saw a monster and still hold on to that memory to this day.\n\nMine was when I was 10, and tried to hang myself.\n\nMeet me: Nimdok. An auburn-headed little demon that just couldn't stay out of trouble at school. Most teachers called me a menace, a problem child, and a variety of other... colorful names.\n\nNow, I'll be honest with you, I really was a bit of a menace. Talking while the teachers taught, passing notes, making fake hall passes. My grades definitely reflected it; I'm pretty sure the highest grade I had was a C, in P.E. of all things.\n\nMy parents didn't let me off the hook, either. My mom's girlfriend—who had moved in with us about three years before—was a hardhead. I remember when I first met her, she was sweet. Taking us out to dinners, buying us whatever we wanted, when we wanted. But as soon as I turned 10, all that began to change.\nSuddenly, she would scream whenever I messed up small things. It happened fast, from one day to the next.\n\nI remember sneaking out of my room to eat some marshmallows. I knew they were there because I saw my parents buy them at the market earlier, so I thought, why not? I slowly opened the door to my room—which was a repurposed office turned bedroom with a big box TV and a VHS player—and made my way through the dark living room to the kitchen. I remember the tile feeling cold against my bare feet and thinking about just how awesome those marshmallows were going to taste. I got to the kitchen, which was big and open, and flicked on the light. One by one, I started checking cabinets.\n\nNope, not this one. On to the next.\n\nI was on my third cabinet when I felt a hand, much bigger than my own, grab my shoulder and spin me around.\n\nIt was my mom's girlfriend.\n\nShe smacked me hard across the face and popped me in the mouth. Immediately, pain exploded from my bottom lip. The taste of copper flooded my mouth as I covered it with my hands, blocking it from further attacks. I ran my tongue along the inside of my bottom lip and could feel where one of my teeth had split the skin. Shit.\n\nI looked up. Her towering figure blocked the light from the kitchen. Whimpering and covering my mouth, I began to cry. One of the first times I had ever cried in that house.\n\"Nimdok, what the FUCK is wrong with you?\" she screamed. \"Are you a fucking thief? You know I can call the cops on you for doing this? I KNOW that's not how your mom raised you! Should I call the fucking cops on you?\"\n\nMy mind immediately jumped to the thought of being alone. It was one of my biggest fears at the time. I knew I should have cared about getting a juvenile record or whatever, but I was young. I didn't want to be away from my mom. She was my only friend; none of the kids at school talked to me. That's why I acted out so much, I guess. I wanted their attention.\n\nI cried and wiped snot from my nose. \"N-no, p-please d-don't,\" I said between sniffles.\nAnother smack. This time harder than the last, absolutely railing the side of my face. My head whipped sideways, and I smacked my nose on the refrigerator next to me. Red ooze started gushing from my nose. I looked up at her, attempting to ask for a napkin, my voice still stuttering.\n\nFor a second, just a brief second, I thought I saw the anger drain from her face. She looked stunned, almost shocked, and her hands shot to her sides as if she didn't know what to do with them.\n\n\"Can I p-please get a napkin?\" I asked again.\nImmediately, the shock was replaced by anger. Or was it frustration? I honestly couldn't tell. But she looked furious.\n\n\"Get one yourself. You're a big boy. It's right there,\" she said, pointing to the roll of paper towels on the counter. As I grabbed one and began to wipe my face and now-bloodied shirt, she continued. \"Listen, Nimdok, your mom and I have come to an agreement, and we've been talking about this a lot. We think we have been too generous and rewarding of your bad behavior. You promised to bring your grades up by the end of the month, and you failed to do that. I'm sorry, Nimdok, but if you can't figure out how to behave and act properly, we will be sending you to military school. No ifs, ands, or buts. That's what we're doing, and that's it. Go take a shower and change, then go to your room. I'm switching the locks inside out so you don't come out and steal anymore. I'm sick of you.\"\n\nI took off my shirt and began to walk back to the restroom to get cleaned up, but her voice cut through the wet sounds of my bloodied steps.\n\n\"By the way, Nimdok, I want you to know that you're lucky I took you in. You're a weight on our shoulders that we're struggling to keep up, and you're doing nothing to help. Do you understand what I'm telling you? Nimdok. C'mon, take a guess.\"\n\nMy already scrambled mind searched for the nearest solution. \"Um, I have to behave better?\" I asked innocently.\n\n\"No. It means WE DON'T WANT YOU. Not because we don't love you—your mom loves you tons—but because you're doing more harm than good. To all of us. Just do me a favor and get out of my sight.\"\n\nAnd with that, it ended. I took a shower, changed, and went to bed. I mean, it was all I could do. The next morning, my mom and her partner came in with a drill and changed the lock on my door so it locked from the outside. I was too lost in my mind to notice.\n\nSomething about her words made me feel sick about myself. Every time I looked in the mirror, I saw something I didn't recognize. A disease, a burden, a bastard. I guess it comes full circle, huh? Born a bastard to unwed parents, still a bastard to a new parent. Fucking tragic.\nOne night I was lying in bed. My parents had bought me a new bunk bed, meant for me and my baby brother, who slept in a crib nearby. I was sleeping on the top bunk, not because of anything specific, but because I liked being high up. I remember climbing it and looking down. It had to be a solid six-foot drop from top to bottom. Cool.\n\nThings had changed. My mom's girlfriend continued to \"discipline\" me, and my mom continued to go to work every day. She worked long hours, and I rarely saw her anymore. I was punished a lot of the time and spent most of my days in my room, locked in, watching old movies on the VHS player. I had wanted a phone, but my parents told me I was far too misbehaved for that.\n\nDay-to-day life was mostly the same. Wake up, go to school, get home, go to my room. If I needed to use the bathroom, they would toss me a bucket that I had to empty at the end of each day. I watched a ton of old movies over and over; I still have Ace Ventura: Pet Detective memorized. The way Jim Carrey played him comforted me somehow. I remember memorizing and repeating some of his goofy catchphrases to myself. It made me feel cool.\n\nBut still, every day, there was this gnawing ache in the back of my mind. Her words from that night echoed over and over. Every time I closed my eyes or lost focus, I would hear her.\n\n\"WE DON'T WANT YOU.\"\n\nSometimes I cried myself to sleep. I missed my mom hugging me and reading me bedtime stories. I missed sleeping in the same bed as her. I missed being her little angel. Sometimes I even prayed that she would come in and kiss me goodnight.\n\nShe never did.\n\nWas it my fault? Was it something that I did? I couldn't tell. I wanted to be with my mommy, my best friend. The person who would talk to me when nobody at school would. I missed her so much. I hated this fucking room. I hated everything about it: the fucking VHS player, the ugly color of the paint, the box TV, and the fucking lock on the door. I hated it. I fucking hated it with every fiber of my being. Without thinking, lost in angry thought, I got up, jumped down, and kicked the door as hard as I could.\n\nA shockwave went up my leg, starting at my toes and ending at my lower back, and I flew backward. I picked myself up and glared at the door.\n\nIt was still closed. It hadn't moved.\n\nMy mind raced. I hated this life. I hated being alive. Every day was lonely, and I was sick of being alone. I didn't want to hurt my parents anymore, and they didn't want me as it was. I looked around the room for a solution.\n\nMy eyes stopped on a bungee cord that had been used to help build the bunk bed, and my mind started doing calculations. If I removed myself from the family, then I would be happy because I wouldn't feel lonely anymore, and my parents wouldn't have to deal with the burden that was me. The fucking disgusting monster I had become to them.\n\nI quickly grabbed the cord and looped it around the ceiling fan, standing on the bedframe of the bottom bunk. I created the best excuse for a noose I could, considering I'd only seen them in old movies on VHS, fashioning an 'O' at the bottom of the bungee cord with some haphazard knots. The cord stretched and creaked as I worked. Eventually, I had it set up just the way I wanted.\nI wrapped it around my neck, still standing on the bed frame for support, and looked down at the floor.\n\nNow, usually, you would think that my life flashed before my eyes at this point. Nope.\nWhat I felt was a cold and deep sense of acceptance. A feeling that this was how it was supposed to end. A feeling that I had finally found a solution and, for the first time in a long time, would do something helpful for my parents.\n\nAnd with a smile, I let myself fall from the bed frame.\n\nThe first thing I felt was the rubber stretching across my neck. I expected a sudden drop, but the cord groaned and stretched. Not quite enough for my feet to reach the ground, though. I bounced a few times, closing my eyes, accepting that it all was finally going to end. But... nothing.\n\n1, 2, 3...\n\nI was still breathing.\n\n7, 8, 9...\n\nI opened my eyes. I was dangling from the cord, but I wasn't choking. I wasn't heavy enough. Had I used a classic rope, it might have been a different story, but this bungee cord had just enough give for me to dangle there.\n\nI was dumbfounded, confused as to why I wasn't dying, why I wasn't choking. At that moment, I heard the knob on my door turn. My attention immediately shot to the door as I heard my mom's voice calling my name.\nI was instantly excited. I wanted to see her. But I hadn't thought about the fact that I was still dangling and was forced to wait as she opened the door.\n\nHer eyes scanned the room and eventually rested on me. I expected a face of shock, of terror. But she looked dismissive, bored almost. She sensed that I wasn't in immediate danger. She knew I would need a real rope to do any actual damage.\n\nJust as fast as she opened the door, she closed it. Without another word. Leaving me to get myself down somehow.\n\nI began sobbing violently, swinging myself until eventually I got free, falling to the floor with a hard whomp. That was my mom, and she didng't even care.I cried myself to sleep that night, and many nights after that.\n\n\"This is my life now,\" I told myself. \"I have to accept it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNotes from the author:\n\nHii my name's Tripped and this is my second project ever! I would like to emphasize that this work of absolute art (if I do say so myself) is a authentic and real experience that happened to me. I am a Blue Ribbon Survivor (RBS) and have taking a liking to the horror genre. I am new to writing so I decided to ease myself in with genuine memories and real experiences that I went through. I would love advice and opinions and am 100% open to criticism! I understand my stories cover sensitive topics but don't let that stop you from dragging me through the mud if you so please. Thank you so much for your support, reddit. :>"

    "text": "When I was a small child (i’m nearly 30 now) my parents got my older sister and I rabbits. We lived in the country and were involved in the local 4-H group. The rabbits lived outside in a large fenced in prairie-like enclosure with an enclosed dog-house like bed of wood shavings, and in the winter months they were in hutches in the barn with a heater. They were essentially wild animals who lived outside in our large farm yard, “out of sight, out of mind” as my sister put it. They were not pet or held and did not like us touching them. We had no bond.\nHer rabbit ran away and she said she was glad because it was probably happier. \nShe feels bad too but says we have to forgive ourselves.\nI do not recall if I fed it everyday, my mom says I did but I just don’t remember. I certainly did not clean their bedding potty shavings often enough and it was filthy. I had and have a lot of mental health issues, which is certainly no excuse, but I had a lot on my mind. I am upset that my parents got them for us so young and did not teach us to be better pet parents or keep us responsible and I regret not taking better care of them as a teenager when I should’ve known better.\nShe died in the mud with a very sudden tumor 😢\nI couldn’t even be there for her in her last days. I ran away in shock and my parents did nothing to help her either. I am absolutely horrified because I LOVE animals and I’m a very sensitive kind person.\nAs an adult, I have fish and a dog who I adore, and I take impeccable care of them because I do not want to make any of the same mistakes and be a bad pet parent. Anytime I think “I don’t feel like cleaning the fish tank, it can wait another day” I say “no, don’t be lazy and take care of them,” and I clean it anyway. \n"

After graduation along with my preparation for exams, i started doing free lancing. Started by making logos, small posters...etc.  which eventually turns to a firm that makes awesome websites and applications. Once i completed wishes of my parents, i thought of fulfilling wishes of people that comes to me.\n\nI bought a fancy bag and filled some random currencies in it. When some one comes to me asking help, i used to ask their lucky number. What ever be the number, they can take that much currencies from bag without actually seeing the same. Many of the time, they were professional beggars and my efforts made no changes to most of them. So i decided not to give money anymore instead ask their biggest wish and make it happen.  It started giving me happiness as the smiling face and that too from bottom of their hearts are the best reward. \n\nAfter few months, i realized that my philanthropy is much above my income. I cannot make everyone happy. So there should be a criteria. I made a separate bank account and moved 50% of my income to the same. After a long research , i found that people with critical illness have limited time to fulfill their wish. Then onwards granting wishes become more beautiful. \n\nNow my first priority is to children with critical illness, Then children with disabilities, then adults with critical illness, with disabilities so on. By this, i could make the best deserving person happy with my income. Now im proud to tell you that i fulfilled more than 3000 life changing wishes of children and more than 5000 of adults. This is my fixed deposit.  I could have done more if i targeted genuine demands earlier. \n\nThe sole purpose of this post is to humbly request attention to your fellow beings. When you have health and money, you wont care anyone. Also even if you are willing to help, never give to random people, narrow down and make sure your hard earned money reached the most deserving hand.\n\nGod bless you."

We had sex again. \n\nI don’t know who that person was that took over. Apart of me was so angry with him for using me for sex and another part of me really enjoyed the sex.

    "text": "\nSome quick context: I've been gay since middle school, but about a year ago, I transferred to a new high school, and I just wanted to be straight. So, I didn’t tell people I was gay, even though I was open about it at my last school. As I settled into this new high school, I made friends with some guys there (they were hot), and we got along well. As we got closer and hung out more, one of them—I'll call him Kayden—was tall and fine, and we became very close.\n\nThe next semester, I switched into his class, and I kind of went from being a chill dude to acting like a wimp. I lowkey liked it. He and his friends would always boss me around, bully me, humiliate me, and more, and I was into it. I allowed it to happen and just took it like a \"good boy,\" purposely putting myself into situations where they could treat me like that, even though it made me look like a total pushover. I didn’t care. During that class they have sat on my face and farted on it, shoved their feet in my face with their dirty sweaty socks on, also they always made me call them daddy and called me good boy and i liked it all. \n\nKayden and I would have sleepovers, and I would purposely fall asleep first so he could do gross things to me while I was \"asleep\"—I’d fake sleep and stay conscious the whole time just to know what he was doing. That kind of thing turns me on: being \"unconscious\" while someone does stuff to you. It’s hot to me, especially since he liked to put his feet in my face and fart on me. I would secretly sniff it up.\n\nEven when I wasn’t pretending to sleep, we’d wrestle, and I’d make myself vulnerable so he could easily shove his toes in my face or squat over it and fart. He basically bullied me, but I liked it. These sleepovers happened a few times until he started thinking of me as just a straight-up bitch. But he liked to just shove his feet all over my face and i would just take it like a good boy and sniff it up. \n\nThen, one of our good friends hosted a big sleepover, and I did the same thing: fell asleep first but stayed conscious the whole time. They did the most disgusting stuff to me—farting on my face at least 40 times because there was two lot of them and they would squat right over my nose and face with their butts right over hovering and letting it rip that potent gas and every time, I’d take a big whiff and sniff it also they were in their underwear so it was right in my face. They shoved dirty socks in my mouth until I was coughing and then had me drink dirty sock water too. They forced my face into their armpits and then one of them shoved their toes in my mouth and rubbed their nasty sweaty feet all over my face. I just accepted it like a good boy. After all that, they made me call them \"daddy\" before they went to sleep, and I enjoyed every second of it—and they didn’t even know.\n\nSo yeah, I pretended to be straight to get into the boys' sleepovers and fell asleep first. Next time you have a sleepover, just remember: one of your friends might be into it."

    "text": "Não estou em busca de validação, gostaria apenas de lavar minha alma e, além disso, ver o que fariam em minha situação.\n\nEstou em um relacionamento aprox. 2 anos e 7 meses. Iniciamos no ultimo ano do ensino medio, o que foi uma fase ótima (apesar da imaturidade, enem, de tudo...) mas ai cada um foi fazer faculdade em uma cidade e a distância foi um problema.\n\nA cidade que ele foi existia uma cultura muito desrespeitosa quanto a relacionamentos, foi para uma república tradicional, festas todos os dias... ja eu fui para uma cidade calma e tranquila (nunca saí e sempre em casa). No começo houve bastante conflito por causa da adaptação, da falta de atencao e de como ele vivia a mesma vida universitária (bebida mt, mt festa e ele nao era assim) mas estávamos melhorando (porém isso desgasta).\nAte entao em um mes aleatório ele ficou mais distante e, para eu nao piorar as coisas, fui sendo boazinha cm tudo que ele fazia, porém tivemos um conflito enquanto ele estava numa festa.\nTive uma crise de ansiedade fortíssima, e queria de toda forma resolver aquilo na hora, mas ele queria curtir a festa e, após eu ligar varias vezes, ele disse q terminaria comigo.\nEu nao aguentei, quebrei toda e numa atitude extrema peguei uma carona aleatoria e fui na cidade dele. Após uma longa conversa pesadíssima, eu o coagi mt e ele soltou que tinha vontade de ficar com uma menina da sala dele e queria terminar por isso tambem, o que me quebrou muito... apesar de tudo eu disse que ajudaria ele a lidar com isso e falei pra ele se decidir o que ele queria. \nTivemos alguns conflitos pesados depois (nessa epoca) por atitudes dele e, apesar de eu perdoar eu fiquei traumatizada e ate hoje aquele menina eu fico neurotica.\nEnfim, deu tudo certo, ele deixou de ser influenciado e parou de ser um universitário aberração para o homem q eu conhecia... isso tudo em setembro de 2024\n\n\nPra que esse contexto? Porque agora eu fiz errado, nao que eu seja perfeita mas nunca tinha feito nada de errado com ele (alem de birras, esse tipo de coisa) e nao quero contar porque justamente sei o quanto quebrou o relacionamento uma leve possibilidade de traição,  se eu falar vai destruir ele e nao é o que eu quero (pois eu o amo e o quero bem).\n\nEu decidi mudar de faculdade e agora em outubro irei estudar na faculdade da cidade dele, nao aguentava a distância. Porém, no último mes antes da mudanca eu trai...\n\nEnquanto as aulas nao começaram eu arrumei um serviço, para arrecadar dinheiro e nao ficar atoa, nesse servico tava tudo acerto ate agosto. \nEu sempre vejo meu namorado 2 fins de semana no mes e nesse mes em especial ficamos mais de 1 mes inteiros sem se ver, o que nao seria um problema se ele fosse presente no relacionamento (ele estava muito ocupado e nao falava comigo direito, mas saia cm amigos e etc) o que me corroeu.\nUm rapaz do servico que sempre foi muito engraçado acabou virando meu amigo, conversávamos de tudo, jogávamos (ate entao inofensivo), depois ele comprava doce pra mim, me dava carona e eu fui deixando ele tomar o espaço do meu namorado. Mas depois foi ficando nítido q ele era doido comigo, literalmente me pedindo beijo e eu recusei sempre e sempre, deixava bem claro que nao queria, eu o pedia para parar de ficar me cantando e me sentia mal (mas n queria me afastar pois me sentia sozinha).\nDepois de um tempo fui gostando, a autoestima foi subindo, fui lendo as mensagens como se fosse meu namorado e acabei idealizando alguem nessa pessoa. O que ja tava errado porque eu dei corda.\n\nMeu namorado voltaria para cidade so 06/09 e eu nao havia ficado com ele ainda (inclusive ele chegou a me agarrar do nada e pedi para me soltar, nao beijei n fiz nada, depois tive uma crise pesada dps) mas eu percebi que eu tava sendo uma otaria.\nSempre amei e amo meu namorado, mas percebi esse fim de semana que eu inconscientemente pensava nesse cara, sonhava cm ele e nao tava conseguindo afastar (eu falei pro meu namorado desse cara, falei do que sentia e pedi ajuda, ele disse q quando ele voltasse as coisas iam melhorar, mas nao melhorou), minha cabeca na tava corroída.\nEu simplesmente nao parava de pensar nesse homem e ja me culpava mt por isso, pq automaticamente eu comecei a ser babaca no meu relacionamento pra ele terminar ou trair e eu ter essa chance de fazer o mesmo. Entendam que eu nao queria terminar, mas existe uma parte de mim cancerígena q tava buscando isso. Eu realmente quero casar, ter filhos e tudo com esse homem, é tudo que eu mais quero. "

    "text": "No domingo de tarde, eu na minha casa, estava entediada e fui falar com esse cara (lembrem que inicialmente ele era meu amg entao é ate uma pessoa legal de conversar), conversa atoa mas tomou um rumo diferente e falamos umas besteiras.\nEu nao sei porque fiz isso, nao sou assim... mas eu falei com ele que não ia fazer nada e nao queria, deixei claro que nao, mas como que leva a serio se eu dou corda?????\nNa segunda eu estava trabalhando, fui fazer uma medição em um apartamento e estava esperando fornecedores chegar.  Essa desgraça descobriu onde eu tava e foi la, eu sozinha no apartamento pq ele iria???? Levou sorvete, eu sentei no chão e comi (sabia q no chão ele n conseguiria fazer nd). Conversamos normal, tava ate estranho, nem conseguia olhar na cara dele (eu era receptiva so por mensagem, pessoalmente nunca foi nada).\n\n\nAte eu levantei para colocar o sorvete na pia pois tava embrulhando meu estômago, ai ele disse que veio só por mim e me abraçou (agarrou). So que eu nao sabia sair, ele ficava me pressionando e tentando me beijar e eu dizia q n queria so q ele nao para e eu falei o seguinte \"eu vou deixar uma vez só, depois vc me deixa em paz\". Porque enquanto eu tava no abraço pensei q se eu fizesse uma vez só eu perceberia o lixo que estava sendo com meu namorado e voltaria a ser quem eu era cm ele, tratando-o bem. Além disso, eu estava obcecada por esse homem, se eu desse um beijo eu veria q tudo q eu to projetando nele é falso, que nao existe e que nao tenho vontade, que é apenas uma carencia advinda de um mes sozinha.\nAi ele aproveitou essa minha frase estúpida, que realmente foi um sim, e me beijou. Que coisa nojenta, que horror, nao porque ele nao sabe fazer, mas pq eu nao quis. Eu tava fazendo robótico, como um passo a passo e pensando em varias coisas menos naquele momento.\n\nTudo doia, mas esse cara nao largava, ai eu ficava cortando o beijo mas ele sempre voltava e ele é um homem forte me fechando, eu simplesmente so ia tambem (ja tava lascada mesmo). Enfim, nao sei nem se ele pegou na minha bunda ou nao (tava de calça jeans) pq eu nao lembro, eu congelei... consigo sentir a porra do cheiro até agr e tudo me enjoa.\n\nEu falei com ele que nao estava me sentindo bem por isso, que nao iria fazer denovo, que nao ia mais falar com ele e que nao quero mais. Porem o krl so ficava falando ah sla oq eu tenho q aproveitar minha chance então e que nojo, ficava me pressionando na parede como se eu tivesse gostando. Enfim, pedi pra ele embora e ele nao ia, mas depois foi...\n\nAssim que ele saiu dei a chorar, fui trabalhar um lixo e estou me sentindo um lixo ate agora.\nLados bons: consegui finalmente tirar esse inferno da minha cabeça e agora finalmente não tenho desejo nenhum por esse homem, apenas um nojo (eu sei q nao foi assedio, eu consenti, mas sabe a sensacao e ter sido cosgida? É tipo assim, como se nao fosse da minha própria vontade - ate porque ele fez a mesma coisa antes e eu tinha resistido).\nOutro lado bom que passei a valorizar novamente o que eu tenho e estou tratando meu namorado como ele merece, o fazendo feliz como ele me faz e o amando muito. Me empenhada novamente a isso.\n\nLado ruim: além do medo de perder meu namorado a qualquer momento, sinto uma culpa absurda. Uma dor física, uma vontade de morrer e de chorar o tempo todo. Sim ele ja está bloqueado de tudo.\n\nEu simplesmente to a um passo de largar tudo, eu so nao quero existir, quero definhar e parar de sofrer. Eu sei que contar nao vai mudar nada, e nessa opção ainda vou fazer mal ao meu namorado, que eu nao quero (sofrendo so tem que ser eu)\n\nDaqui 4 semanas me mudo dessa cidade pra sempre, nunca mais verei ngm e muito menos esse homem. Quero começar minha vida com meu namorado e eu sabia que se fosse com esse pensamento de merda (de ficar pensando nesse homem) ia fuder tudo mas pelo menos agora sei q meu relacionamento dará certo (eu resolvi esse cancer), mas agora surgiu outro... vontade de morrer"

I was ashamed when I was a kid with curly hair, and I was ashamed when I was older and had damaged hair, and now I'm ashamed that I wear a wig to cover up the previous issues.

    "text": "Warning: long (and probably confusing) story, I recommend it as a bedtime story or something to do if you want to stop scrolling! \n\nI do volunteering for a group of students that do creative content, and we were asked to photograph a normal student party. We got this request about 24 hours before the party, when you are supposed to request two weeks prior, however somehow the “boss” of our group agreed to it anyways, although he couldn’t even photograph himself that night. My friend could photograph the beginning of the party but she wanted to be in bed by 11, so I said, only because no one else came forward, that I can photograph later that evening but that I was going on a bar crawl before that with a group of friends (this had been planned weeks earlier and I had no intentions of cancelling it last minute in favor for some volunteer work). I thought that it was fine for me to drink because my boss said that the party organizers mostly wanted some group photos of everyone before the party started which were the photos my friend was going to take before going home to sleep.\n\nI go to my bar crawl, have a couple of drinks and shots and was decently drunk but not black out drunk level. I take my other friend with me who is also in our volunteer group because she knows photography way better than me (my official task in the group is actually something else but I don’t want to share too many details, hers is photography) and we get to go to the “personnel” room (where our safe with the cameras are) where only the party organisers get to be and I leave my stuff there instead of the crowded cloakroom. Since photography is not my task I hadn’t used a camera in over half a year so I let my friend (who probably was even more drunk than me) fix the camera settings since I didn’t remember how to work it out. We try to take some photos of the party but the flash does not want to operate on command so half the photos don’t have the flash on since it just didn’t work. The flash has had some problems before and I doubt that I would have been able to fix things even if I had been sober, however tbh I didn’t really care because I was drunk and I wanted to party with the rest of my friends, not “work”, especially since photography is not my passion and I only did it so that we would at least get a couple of photos.\n\nThe next day my “boss” from the volunteer group calls me and my friend who took the photos during the later part of the evening because the party organizers had complained about us and were mad because the photos we had taken had not turned out great. Most of them were apparently really blurry which could either be because my friend had, according to the boss, apparently screwed up the camera settings, or because it was so sweaty and humid inside (you could tell because the windows and doors were all foggy, and a sober person also confirmed this to my boss). My boss told the organizers this but they denied it and said that there was no way humidity could have made the photos blurry (although apparently they had apologized to other people for the heat and humidity, saying that the AC was broken, so I don’t understand why they would say different things to different people). Now the organizers (or at least part of that group) think that me and my friend used them to get free drinks at the party (the deal was that we took photos and got free drinks as a reward). Whenever we photograph events, which are usually dinners, the policy is that the photographer should get a free dinner + drinks that come with the dinner, so for just a party like this getting a few free drinks instead makes sense. We took one drink each in the beginning of the night, before we realized that we didn’t know how to fix the lighting issue, and sure I was glad to get a free drink, but I think that it is unfair for them to think that we used them considering that we only took one drink each and didn’t ask for anything else for free for the rest of the evening. At the event, everyone from the organizer group seemed friendly with me and we talked and everything seemed to be fine, they didn’t give off the vibe that they wanted some museum worthy pieces of work from their afterparty.\n\nI have photographed the same organization’s events before, including one similar party, where I stayed for hours without getting any sort of payment or even a free drink (I didn’t ask for it so maybe it was my own fault, but no one offered me anything either), one dinner that I extempore had to jump in as makeshift photographer that I paid the full price for myself, and one breakfast event (where I was offered food, but I chose not to take anything myself which is ofc my own decision). So I think that as a photographer I have been generous with my time and effort towards this group of people and I have been sober or very lightly drunk at all their other events and done a really good job (for not being a professional photographer). Yes, it’s a shame that the camera didn’t work, maybe I could have worked it out if I had been sober, maybe not, but how fun would it have been to go to a bar crawl and be the one who takes all the non-alcoholic options? The bar crawl was something I had looked forward to for weeks and it was my top priority, the party was just my after party that I happened to photograph. I feel embarrassed, my boss removed me from all other events I had said that I could help photograph for the fall, and I lowkey don’t even want to contribute to this volunteer group anymore although I have friends there. Despite all of this, I can’t help but feel angry towards the group, they probably made thousands from this party that they can freely use on whatever they like, me and my friend sacrified our time with our other friends (and yes, I definitely did some stupid drunk things on the side such as taking some photos in the personnel room with a guy from the organizing group, nothing nfsw or anything like that though, but me and my friend still honestly treid) to work out a broken camera and then we get blamed and blacklisted by the organizers and I pretty much got blacklisted by our boss too (my friend still has some events she is going to photograph). Hopefully you enjoyed my rant and this messy story, if you understood even ten percent what was going on I give you an applause!"

    "text": "In modern India, almost every visit to a government office feels like stepping into a hidden toll booth—except the toll is a bribe, often expected but rarely talked about. It’s not just about dodging traffic fines anymore. Bribes have crept into passport verifications, driving license applications, and countless bureaucratic processes. If you’re buying or selling property, you know the drill all too well: revenue and registrar’s offices sometimes feel like corruption hubs disguised as official spaces.\n\nHere’s my story: My father, a retired military veteran, bought a piece of land and registered the sale at the Sub-Registrar office in Bengaluru North back in 1995. That’s when the saga began. Years later, I took it upon myself to fight legally and refuse to bow down to corruption.\n\nUnderstandably, most people just negotiate the price and pay up. Some call in connections—senior officials, politicians, influential friends—to grease the wheels. But, that comes with its own tangled web of social costs. The sad truth? Honesty is often the harder, lonelier path.\n\nMy story is about the uphill battle I faced refusing to pay bribes, navigating the legal labyrinth, and standing my ground for what’s right. It’s a story of struggle, patience, and hope that the system can change—one honest fight at a time.\n\n[TLDR; link to my legal fight and court orders](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceIndia/comments/1mqtx7z/independence_day_musings_we_as_a_nation_are/). The Contempt of court petition is still pending in the High Court while I remain hopeful. "

I was in the back of a large classroom and the teacher was listening to music so I wasn't really doing my work, my friend max, told me if I wanted to just skip. I said \"no\" he said \"cmon bro\" and I folded like a piece of paper.\n\n\"alright fine whatever\" and we snuck out of the class. but to understand how this happened, you need to know the layout of this odd classroom. The teachers desk was in the corner, and the door was cracked behind me, who was in the back of this classroom. So me and max just walked out. we saw a teacher In the hallway, but we just walked around like we owned the place and that teacher didn't bat an eye. we walked straight out of school. and into the forest, for some reason this dude max was obsessed with drugs and guns and killers. but this dude was opening his backpack like it was the fucking one piece. this dude was looking as if whatever is in this backpack is watermelon on a hot day. anyway, what was in his backpack was bleach, and ammonia based toilet cleaner. and he mixed these two chemicals inside his little metal water bottle.\n\nAnd he told me to follow him. god knows why I did, but I did. and he brung me to his motorcycle. he told me to drive mine, but mine was in front of the school. so we drove over to the school and slowly but surely we made our way over to it. I got on and we rode to safety from the view of the school. then (being the idiot I am) I told him to lead me wherever. he led me to his aunts. even though I had no idea where his aunt lived, he said it belonged to his aunt who raped him when he was Younger. I would like to believe I did not murder an innocent lady, but I don't know. but as we arrived we took out the chlorine gas, walked to her car, (we are in Florida, in the middle of the summer so everyone kept their windows cracked) and I poured this mixed solution all over the inside of her car, and we waited. the next day max comes to summer camp with a smirk on his face. \"my aunt is in the hospital!\" he exclaimed with a huge grin. nothing eventful happened that day though. the next day was Saturday. so he rode his motorcycle over to my house. and he practically was jumping at me \"she's dead! she's dead!\" "

I also had water beside the bed and sipped on it whenever I turned over.. what could possibly go wrong?\n\nFast forward to this morning, I woke earlyish with a feeling like a bowling ball moving round my lower stomach/bowels, not painful but strange.. I lay there for a few more minutes to see if the feeling passed, then I had a sudden 'arrival feeling', I clenched it off and decided to make way to the bathroom, I had barely arrived at a hover when everything broke loose. Thank goodness I decided to go when I did.\n\nMuch relieved I want to make myself a coffee in the kitchen, still in PJ shorts and tee top, thankfully panties under too! Just in case.\n\nI was sitting in my kitchen, had two of three sips into coffee reading SM posts when the second feeling arrived, a slight rumble like gas. Knowing I had purged. Thinking it was safe, I just shifted on the kitchen chair and relaxed my rear to relive what I thought was gas.. Well OMG, my brain had a split second of relief before a sudden horrific realisation that a new warmth was spreading rapidly up between my cheeks... Oh the absolute Horror!!!.. the rest is seriously TMI.. but very amusing,\n\nMy girlfriend made an appearance in the kitchen shortly after, looking somewhat red faced and shocked. LOL. She had joined me in the cleanse, though took slightly less. As I would discover, she suffered a similar fate! haha\n\nMy mom howled with laughter when I phoned her. So funny! There is more to tell about the tale.\n\nAnyone else with similar mishaps feel free to share, I need a giggle!\n\nPS. Eight hours later and my gf and I are still having little issues! haha"

The real system controlling the world is far more tangible: politics, corporations, and religions. Scriptures were rewritten, meanings twisted, all to prevent humans from awakening. Anyone who begins to see clearly threatens the societal balance threatens the slavery system the elites have built.\n\nThrough studying Buddhism, Hinduism, and parts of Christianity, I saw a common thread: all point toward self-awakening and awareness of consciousness, guiding humans to recognize and master the very desires, fears, and lusts that the system exploits.\n\nAfter waking up from the illusion, I realized that my identity itself is a tool and a trap. We cling to identities and human attachments, which the illusion uses to bind us. Lord Krishna called this Maya, and Buddhism named it Samsara.\n\nMy life has never been the same since that moment.

I left Cuba running from communism, dreaming of a better life, and instead I found myself locked in a cage, treated like a criminal.\n\nInside I saw things that haunt me.

Prison is hell on earth, especially if you are innocent.\n\nI know the system has to process people but nothing can justify the psychological torture of living every day not knowing when you’ll be free. Even after I was released, I wasn’t really free. I carried that place inside me like a shadow.\n\nI fell into drugs. At first it was a way to escape, then it became another kind of prison. I’m ashamed of how far I let myself sink. For a while I thought I would never get out, that maybe I didn’t even deserve to.\n\nBut three months after quitting, I met the woman who is now my wife. She believed in me when I couldn’t believe in myself. She pushed me to study film, and that’s how I made The Addiction. It’s not perfect, it’s raw and messy, but it was the first time I took all the darkness in me and turned it into something outside myself.\n\nI’m still not healed.

I started going out of my way to steal some of her panties and god knows what i did with them. Even the used ones. It had become an obsession. But it would die down unless something would make it come back. Which takes me to about 4 months ago. During summer, as i would stay up late playing video games, i went to the bathroom on my way there i heard something from my parent's room. And then as you guessed, i heard them doing the deed and heard my stepmom moan. After that accident, i definelty changed. Almost every night, i would camp outside their closed door and started recording the sounds. I even hid an old phone next to their bed to record. I would wish if i could slightly open the door and see them doing the act.I was losing my mind. But then she went to vacation to her home coyntry see family and i calmed myself. Recently, i've been having the worse time. I've been sick for almost a month and i broke a bone and because of that i'm behind at Uni. So keep in my mind i'm really frustrated. Stepmom recently came back from the trip back at her home country. The next day my pulses came back when i reheared them doing the deed while going to the bathroom. The day after which is today, my dad had a work trip for a couple days. I don't know why now. I decided to do what the title is saying. I sneaked into her room. I tried to gently lift the blanket to catch a picture but i wasn't satisfied enough. Just by saying what i did i should be put to jail. I tried lifting her panties and she woke up. She told me inoncently: \" oh you are here my love, you scared me\" and she went back to lay down. I froze in shock of my decision and my actions. The amount of videos i watched fried my brain and decided to take actions today. I\nWas thinking back of everything i did and how horrible of a human being i am. She then told me to get up and get out as i wasn't moving. I then texted her i'm sorry. She later went out to the bathroom. I tried to talk to her but she just went back to her room. She is probably sleepy and too tired to think about that. The most horrible thing is my family is pretty religious and my stepmom seems pretty clueless of a young adult having this kind of struggles, because which religious person would do that. Now i'm here talking. I texted her if i could talk to her, but she still hasn't seen them. Maybe she will ignore the incident but i feel way too bad this way. If she really understand what happened i can't let that pass by since she must have lost her trust towards me. She is a really nice person but my dumbass is stupid and a p**n addicted mf. I don't know what to do. Should i confront her tomorow and try  to talk about what happened. Should i avoid talking about the incident, if she is intentionaly forgeting it or she hasn't still catched on. I just feel the worst right now. She was like a friend to me but i decided to let my urges take over.\n\nNote:\nWhy do people not trust my story. You can forget the story, but i need recommendations. This whole situation that i put myself in is so fucked up. I don't know what to do. I acted without looking at the consequences i acted on a pulse. I did something really wrong. Probably hurt someone with my actions and i can't repair anything. Just help me ...\n\n\nUpdate 1. My dad called me when i was in uni. I cannot come back home until he is back from his work trip. He will then call me to come back and talk with me. I deserve everything that happened. I think it's pointless at this point. There is no way to fix my wrongdoings and gain back anyones trust."

I deep dove into porn at a young age because of the internet access I had I got very curious about sex and all of the things and I stumbled across beastiality and never knew what it was. I never actually watched dogs, I honestly think it was cartoons but all the porn and sexual things I was allowed to see I’m guessing made a morbid curiosity\n\nAs I dove deeper into the porn I did an disgusting vile act I got my dog to lick my genital area and I hate myself for it and I have never done it again after that day, it’s been almost 10 years since it’s happened, I am 20 now and it happened maybe when I was 12-13 years old I don’t remember the age because I was so young and it was one instance and I feel like the years after I barely remembered it like that time of my life was such a blur but now it hits me and the guilt and shame of me even doing that makes me want to kill myself.\n\nI love animals and the family dog I have now is my family, I WOULD never ever do that again it makes me feel sick to my stomach that i ever committed such an act and I’m contemplating on whether I deserve to live everyone around me is normal and probably have never done something so vile but I have and I have to live with this for the rest of my life I hate myself for it I really do I want to die right now. \n\nI go to therapy and I’m never telling my therapist because I don’t want anyone to ever know this. I just wanted one time to get it off of my chest. I have a bf of 11 months I’m well liked by my peers but I have such a dark nasty secret that makes me want to end my life, I don’t know how I can ever forgive myself. I am such a disgusting human being and I wish I can hit my younger self or do something to show that’s not what u DO it’s so unsanitary and disturbing for the dog. The main thing that bothers me is the act of what I did.\n\nRE: \nhi guys I have been overwhelmed with the comments telling me im not the disgusting person I feel like I am and maybe I don’t deserve to die for it, I texted my therapist firstly about the SA and self harming thoughts and when I’m ready or if I ever will be I will tell them abt the unforgiving act I did, I do want to clarify I know I have been been traumatized and really didn’t look at how it could alter my brain there’s a lot more I didn’t mention but I don’t want to excuse the action that I did I know I was young but I still feel ashamed that it was wrong, I’m still not too sure of the age of the incident but i feel like knew it was wrong if I didn’t do it again even if it was that one time but I’m so unsure because the memory is so blurry. I’m still honestly confused and wish I could go back to see what I was thinking but I barely remember it. I am overwhelmed with the amount of support and it has made me want to live not only for myself but for the kind people who took the time out of their day to speak to someone like me.

This was BIG DUMB\n\nThank you everyone for scaring me straight\n\nForged My Glasses Prescription With AI To Get A New Pair And Avoid A Two+ Hour Process That Requires Three Visits To The Optometrist\n\nI normally try to avoid this place because they're so inefficient, but they sell the best glasses for my fat and disgusting head shape.\n\nI broke my favourite pair of glasses last year and bought a cheap, ugly pair to hold me over until I could find a 1:1 replacement. The original brand no longer makes glasses, so I couldn't just buy them again.\n\nThis certain optometrist is incredibly inefficient. They're understaffed, so you have to do your eye exam in two visits, each one taking over an hour mostly due to you waiting in line. On the third visit, you pick up your glasses, they do not ship them to you. Prescriptions only last one year.\n\nI tried using other prescription glasses sellers both IRL and online, but no one sold what I was looking for. Online glasses looked slightly similar, but once they arrived, they were too small for my bulbous head. \n\nI frequently checked my usual optometrist's website and they finally stocked what I was looking for in my size. I called and asked if they could mail a copy of my prescription to me, they declined. \n\nIn order to buy from the website, you need a valid prescription that isn't expired. You can upload a picture of a prescription though, as long as it has all the required information.\n\nI went in person to pick up my prescription and they put a fat \"EXPIRED\" label on the bottom of it. It expired one month ago 💔\n\nI took a picture of my prescription, cropped out the \"EXPIRED\" label and asked AI to change the eye exam date and expiration date to 2026. It did it and kept everything else in check. The optometrist's name, ID, and signature were all still there. No weird AI errors. Even my prescription was untouched.\n\nI uploaded the image and ordered the glasses. The website said one of their specialist would review the image before shipping. It was \"pending\" for 2 days and finally got \"verified\" now 🥳 my new glasses come next week. \n\nEvery time I get an eye exam, the optometrist says my prescription is unchanged, so I always get annoyed that I even have to go through the whole process. \n\nThis was something small, but I'm going to use AI to forge other documents to commit fraud before I flee the country💚☺️ I hope to have your support in this journey"

Anyway, he went into hospice care almost two weeks ago after struggling with a battle against stomach cancer and this train of people just came flooding in to visit him. We thought he was just a lonely guy. He passed away Thursday, which was obviously hard, even though I never went to see him. He left everything to me, which includes three properties so I just got off the phone with a real estate agent that my dad worked with and he said he knows a lot of people that my dad knew and that he would spread the word of my dad’s passing. It’s just wild. He never felt safe sharing things with me or my mom and we never felt safe sharing things with him. It’s just such a shame. I don’t know what I did wrong to keep him from telling me about his life. My mom didn’t make plans for a funeral, but we are going to try and honor some Russian traditions, which involve a series of gatherings after the person’s passing. With all of these people coming out of the woodworks, I hope I can piece together some information about my dad’s life. I’m sure it’ll be more than anything I got from him before. "

Me duele aceptarlo, pero necesito ser honesto: en un momento de aburrimiento, curiosidad y vacío, terminé viendo porno y cayendo en algo que nunca debí hacer.\n\nNo fue porque ella no me gustara, ni porque no me llenara, ni porque quisiera a otra persona. Ella siempre me dio todo lo que necesitaba. Fue simplemente por un impulso estúpido, un momento en el que no supe manejar mis emociones ni mi soledad. Y aunque pareciera algo pequeño, para mí fue una traición enorme. Porque yo sabía lo que sentía por ella, y aún así lo hice.\n\nEn el instante en que pasó sentí culpa, vergüenza y un vacío que no se iba. No era placer, era solo un error que me aplastaba por dentro. Lo peor es que pensé “si ella nunca se entera, igual puedo seguir”, pero dentro de mí ya me estaba destruyendo. Me sentía una basura, incapaz de mirarla a los ojos.\n\nCuando ella lo supo, obviamente se rompió. Me dijo:\n\n> “Ningún hombre es capaz de no sentir nada al ver mujeres así, y yo no quiero estar con un hombre así.”\n\n\n\nEsas palabras se me quedaron clavadas, porque sé que de verdad lo sintió. Y yo quisiera poder demostrarle que no es así, que yo no necesito a nadie más, que no me excito con cualquiera, que fue un error puntual en un momento oscuro de mi vida, no algo que me defina.\n\nPero entiendo que desde su mirada fue distinto: ella lo vivió como una traición, como si no fuera suficiente para mí. Y eso me mata, porque en realidad lo único que siempre quise fue hacerla feliz.\n\nHoy vivo con miedo: miedo a que nunca me perdone, miedo a que nunca vuelva a confiar en mí, miedo a que ella crea que lo que hice significa que no la amo. Pero si algo tengo claro, es que la amo demasiado y que no quiero volver a fallar de esa manera.\n\nEstoy intentando cambiar de verdad.\n\nDejé de exponerme a cualquier cosa que me lleve a repetir ese error.\n\nTrato de ser más transparente, de no ocultar nada.\n\nEstoy llenando mis días con cosas que me hagan crecer en vez de destruirme.\n\nY sobre todo, estoy tratando de demostrar con hechos que lo único que quiero es darle seguridad y amor, no excusas.\n\n\nSé que no puedo borrar lo que pasó, y que el perdón quizá nunca llegue. Pero quiero cargar con esa culpa y convertirla en algo que me haga mejor, porque lo que más deseo es que algún día pueda ver que mis actos hablan más fuerte que mis errores.\n\nYo sé que fallé. Pero también sé que ella siempre fue suficiente, que nunca me faltó nada estando a su lado. Lo que me faltó fue madurez, control y cabeza.\n\nY aunque me odie a mí mismo por lo que hice, todavía tengo esperanza de demostrarle que puedo ser mejor.\n\nGracias por leer hasta aquí, y si me pueden aconsejar mejor, necesito ayuda "

We were physical, and also sexted a lot; they had experience with many people since they were 13 which worried me a little. Personally I had only a year experience with one person, a romantic partner but I was also exposed to sexuality online at a very young age (maybe 7 or 8 on), just like them, probably to damaging effects. This situation continued for a few months, we were physical offline twice, and it was fun for us both, we also talked about clothes, cooking, plants, holidays etc.\n\n Life events that Summer made me feel like I was losing control of my life, for one I wasn't able to go to the college I wanted which many of my friends were going to. I began to spiral, including one conversation with the above mentioned person where I (I really regret this) rudely rejected their attempts to give me hope and encourage me to act for myself, I was giving up on myself. I turned to sex as a coping mechanism and over the next few days, I repeatedly asked this person if they wanted to sext, each day or each other day for about five days. I suppose I thought eventually they'd be interested and have the energy but in reality, I guess it was just a bunch of extra pressure while they were just about to start another year of school, worsened by the fact some of their other friends had been mean to them; I think I said it would comfort them as well/also offer them an escape, but I now look back at disgust at saying that. Luckily they kept saying no and when I realised it wasn't simply something they didn't have the energy for that day, but something they actively didn't want to do, after the five (maybe four, maybe six) days, I stopped asking. I went out on a walk and took photos of nature and sent them to them and they said they were pretty. It was like emerging from a hole.\n\nOver the next two months, we talked still but I never asked to sext again and neither did they, I voluntarily started therapy to help cope better but I didn't discuss this; I also tried to confront my parents over my life direction but it didn't go very well. I was still a bit obsessive I fear with my friend over these months, I made sure not to bring up sex for fear of violating their boundaries but, looking back, that wasn't good enough, I was self deprecating and talked to them constantly, asking questions about their college, how they were and stuff. After the two months, they stopped talking to me except in simple responses and it made me realise how I'd gone basically insane over the whole thing, it made me realise what I had done and been from their perspective. I saw them post a tiktok about hating one of their old friends which could have been one of those people from their school or possibly myself, and I didn't feel like it was my place to ask. I apologised on Instagram where I said I shouldn't have broken their boundaries, that nothing they did warranted it, that they were really nice to me and ultimately that I won't bother them anymore; they hearted it. A month later, I wished them a happy birthday, they hearted that and said thanks, that was the last time we talked; they also liked a instagram post I made a few days after that. Eventually we unfollowed each other without talking about it.\n\nI feel so bad about the whole thing, especially but not only those five or so days. Every time I try to talk about it I get worried or, I suppose here where I mentioned my kinda irrelevant young exposure to sexuality and stuff, try to excuse it but its not excusable. Over the last few years I tried to move on but now, I am in a place where I am not in education and only looking for work, so the only thing I wake up to everyday is the past. The guilt I feel has began to keep me up at night. I don't know if this is what I deserve or if moving on is the only way I make sure I don't hurt anyone else or if I am a bad person for thinking I should ever move on. I did talk to deepseek recently who, obviously biased to me tbf and I know I shouldn't trust AI, said that I should learn from it but that it doesn't define me and I am not a sex pest because intent to harm wasn't there and it wasn't repetitive but I don't think I should forgive myself so easily. It also said I should talk to a therapist about it. I have thought about apologising, or just talking to them, again but I won't because I know that is more in my interest than theirs and I shouldn't make myself out to be either a hero or a victim here.\n\nI had a casual experience with another friend lately and felt worried I had made them uncomfortable that I sent them a paragraph apology and they said that they enjoyed it more than me and that I overthink way too much, even that they may ask to do it again. I hope this is just me overthinking like that was although I know, at the same time, I could be underplaying my responsibility to myself to protect my own image of myself and what I did was even worse than I think. So what do I do moving forward and how should I look back moving forward?"

I grabbed a blanket I keep in my trunk, changed into my swimsuit under my clothes, and kicked back for a couple of hours. I even brought a book I’d been meaning to read, and for once, I didn’t check my phone or worry about responsibilities.\n\nBy the time I left, my shoulders felt lighter and my mind clearer.

    "text": "Buenas, desde hace un año tengo la sospecha de que mi viejo es infiel a mi ama así que instale una aplicación en su teléfono para poder rastrear dónde se encontraba y también escuchar los ruidos del entorno de su celular. \n\nComenzaré a partir de unos meses atrás, aprox 8 a 9 meses encontré en su celular mensajes con una piba que es su vendedora (tenemos un minimarket y ella era vendedora de productos Arcor) que le decía para encontrarse y tomar desayunos con corazoncitos y llamadas de ''bebe\" o ''cariño\", cosa que me molestó y lo encaré, obviamente lo negó y me dijo que estaba bromeando y etc. \n\nPude llamar a la señora con todo el respeto que se merece y me dijo que ella nunca había aceptado ninguna salida y que quien insistía era mi viejo y que tenía mucho respeto hacia mi ama, que nunca podría hacer nada así. Al final quedó en una llamada de atención (porque no tenía pruebas de las salidas) y si me enteraba que algo sucedía iba a llamar a la central y hacer que la despidan. \n\nEn este punto comence a dudar mucho de las amistades de mi viejo y sus palabras de excusa, tiene un amigo piurano que se ve con venecas y tiene su pareja de 22 años (el tío tiene 40, aunque la diferencia de edad ya se puede dejar a criterio de cada uno). Se podría decir que son mejores amigos? Así que se prestan para la webada juntos SIEMPRE, cosa que molesta a mi ama, no porque sospeche que es infiel, sino que salen a tomar a altas horas de la noche o se van a hacer las compras juntos y demoran un buen rato. \n\nEl piurano es sobrino de mi gerente así que vive en un taller dónde trabaja como guardián nocturno, el taller queda está relativamente cerca de mi casa. Tiene 4 pisos, el piurano vive en el tercero y al frente de su cuarto hay una oficina, el segundo piso es oficinas administrativas y el cuarto piso es comedor - almacén.\n\nBueno pues, el día de hoy al ver que mi viejo demoraba tanto en ese bendito taller decidí prender mi aplicación y escuchar los sonidos del entorno, previamente lo llame y le dije ''Pa, voy a salir con mi ama a comprar un regalo, porfa ven rápido\" y me dijo ''voy en 5minutos\". Cuando encendí esa bendita app solo se escuchaba silencio y de pronto pum! Gemidos y la piba diciendo ''le dijiste que solo ibas a demorar 5 minutos jaja\", fue el momento donde corte la app y sali corriendo al taller para gritar por la ventana ''Baja piurano, necesito un documento de oficina urgente\" y bajo el tío del último piso, del comedor, donde supuestamente se encontraba tomando con mi viejo. \n\nYo subí hasta el tercer piso porque sabía que la piba estaba ahí metida, subí con mi camara para grabar a mi viejo con la tía pero en esos segundos no se cómo mierda hicieron y se acomodaron todos. La chica estaba desnuda en la oficina del tercer piso, yo estaba intentando forcejear la puerta y mi viejo sale del comedor todo preocupado de \"que pasó, que pasó\".\n\nTuve una discusión fuerte y pude grabar toda la conversación, no creo nada de lo que me dijo mi viejo, que él estaba arriba en el cuarto piso  mientras que su amigo fornicaba en el piso de abajo. Según él estaba \"cubriendo\" la cochinada de su amigo para que mi gerente no se enterará de nada. No tome ninguna foto, no pude conseguir evidencias, solo yo gritando como una loca y ellos tratando de explicar lo sucedido. Pero mi oído no me falla, yo sé lo que escuche y quien sabe quizás hacían un trío de solo pensarlo me da asco, pero sobretodo que mi viejo este haciendo sus webadas y le falte el respeto a mi mamá.\n\nNo le he dicho aún lo que pasó hoy porque no tengo pruebas solo mi palabra, me da miedo contarle sin estar 100% segura y que ella salga herida o hacer que mi familia se desintegre por una conjetura. \n\nEn ese momento las manos me temblaron y sentí la sangre hirviendo, no se me ocurrió pensar en grabar lo que estaba escuchando o hacerle escuchar a mi ama lo que sucedia para que ella saque sus conclusiones. No pensé con la cabeza fría y no salió bien, la tía se retiró como si nada jajajaja y encima le dijo me dijo que el piurano era su pareja desde hace 2 meses, o sea que engaña a su chama y a la mamá de sus hijos que se encuentra en su pueblo natal le pasa una miseria de manutención por sus 2 hijos menores de edad. \n\nNo mentire, mi viejo no es un niño, el sabe lo que hace, sabe con quién se junta y lo que pasó hoy quedará en su conciencia pero yo no sé que hacer, al salir de ese taller me dijo \"ni una palabra a tu mamá\" pero si no hiciste nada malo entonces porque te da miedo, encima tiene la descendencia de decirme que su consciencia está tranquila y que él estaba poniendome a prueba para ver de lo que era capaz o hasta donde quería llegar, bro WTF? \n\nEl día de hoy deje de creer en su palabra y sinceramente se que ese viejo ha estado engañando a mi ama desde que se junto con su amigo piurano hace 1 año y medio. Solo quiero que le diga a mi viejita que ya no la ama que no siente nada por ella y la deje tranquila, yo amo a mi familia y daría la vida por mis viejitos, por ambos, pero tampoco no estoy para aguantar estupideces.\n\nTengo la creencia que una vez que mi viejo ya se prestó para la webada es cuestión de tiempo para que lo vuelva a hacer y ahí le caigo. Psdta, aún no sabe que instale ese programa en su celular obvio, no fui tonta de gritarlo a todo pulmón en nuestra discusión. \n\nSolo quería dejar salir toda esta ira y quizá escuchar/leer algunas recomendaciones de que harían ustedes.. no lo sé, me siento muy decepcionada..

We didn’t resist. We weren’t pressured hard, but we also didn’t want it. It was just one of those moments where everything moved fast and our judgment was clouded.\n\nThe hookup happened. We both remember it  how it felt, how strange it was, how detached we felt from our own actions in that moment.\n\nAfterward, we were both lying next to each other. We didn’t talk. We didn’t overthink. We were just there, naked, messy, tired and we naturally ended up cuddling. It wasn’t for comfort or protection. It was just what happened.\n\nWe fell asleep like that. No deep talk. No big moment. Just silence and exhaustion.\n\nLater in the night, the same friends who were still in the room started again. And we let it happen again.\n\nIn the morning, we found our clothes, got dressed quietly, and went home without saying much.\n\nWe still haven’t talked about it in detail. But I can’t stop thinking about it.\n\nIt wasn’t violent. It wasn’t technically non-consensual. But it also wasn’t something I truly wanted.\n\nNow I carry these vivid, confusing memories.

    "text": "The first thing I hear when I wake up is the screaming.\n\nIt echoes down the hall from the kitchen, so loud it feels like it’s shaking the house. My stomach tightens. I know they’re screaming about me. It’s always about me.\nMy door handle rattles. A key scrapes against metal.\n\nIt’s one of them unlocking the door from the outside. My parents turned my lock around last month after I kept sneaking into the kitchen for candy. They didn't know I could pick it—a skill that has saved me from more than one bathroom accident when they leave me locked in here.\n\nThe door flies open, slamming hard against the wall with a heavy whoomp. I squeeze my eyes shut, pretending to be asleep, but I can feel myself trembling.\n\n\"Nimdok. Wake the fuck up.\"\n\nThe voice spits from the doorway. I slowly open my eyes, putting on my fake \"just woke up\" squint. A phone flashlight cuts through the pitch-black room, blinding me. I can’t see the face behind it, but I know the voice. My Godmother. The woman my mom left my alcoholic dad for two years ago.\n\nShe crosses the room in three steps and grabs me hard by the ear. Not a pinch—her whole palm engulfs my ear, squeezing. Pain explodes, hot and sharp. She starts pulling me out of bed by it. I try to get up, to match her pace, but she’s pulling harder and faster than I can move. I’m only a hundred pounds; she’s more than double that. I can't throw a punch. It’s been drilled into my head too many times: never hit a woman, especially not one of my \"parents.\"\n\nI stumble along with her as she drags me. My ear throbs as one of her nails digs into the cartilage. She throws me against the hallway wall. My head hits the drywall with a sickening thonk. Tears spring to my eyes and I start to beg, looking up at her towering figure.\n\"What did I d—\"\n\nAn open palm cracks across my face, dropping me to my knees. The world rings. She holds up a piece of paper.\n\n\"Are you a fucking retard!?\" she shouts.\nI squint through the ringing. It’s a science test. A big red F, circled, sits at the top.\n\n\"Nimdok, I've given you enough fucking chances. I'm sick of you being an IDIOT. If you can't get your grades up by the end of the month, you can get the fuck out! Your mom agrees. You leech off us and give nothing in return. All I ask is good grades and good behavior, and you can't do either!\"\n\nShe storms back into my room. I hear her rip cords from the wall. She comes out holding my Nintendo 3DS and my Xbox 360. My most prized possessions. My only friends.\n\n\"Follow me,\" she orders.\n\nShe marches through the kitchen, past the laundry room, and out into the backyard toward the pool. The air is cold.\n\n\"You wanna misbehave like a grown man? I'll show you what happens to bad-ass kids.\"\nShe holds up the 3DS. With a sharp crack, she snaps the top screen backward, leaving it dangling by wires. Then she throws it into the deep end. Next, she heaves the Xbox into the water. It sinks instantly.\n\nI’m crying hard now, saying I’m sorry, sorry for being bad, sorry for everything. I don't know how to fix this.\n\nMy mind scrambles. Maybe I should just throw myself in after them. Hook my foot on the drain and never come up. The thought actually makes me feel better. I make her so angry, so stressed. I know she’s a good person deep down; she tells me all the time how much she does for me. The problem isn't her. The problem has always been me. I should just—\n\nLost in thought, I don't realize she’s charging at me until she grabs my wrist. She swings me toward the pool. One second I’m standing and crying; the next I'm airborne.\n\nI splash into the freezing water. My boxers slide down, and as I reach to pull them up, I realize she's still holding both my wrists from the edge of the pool. Before I can take a full breath, she shoves my head and body beneath the surface.\nSurely she won’t hold me here.\n\n1... 2... 3... 4 seconds.\n\nShe's still holding me down.\nI start to pull, to tug, but her grip tightens like a vise. The winter air has turned the pool water shockingly cold. My lungs begin to itch for oxygen.\n\n17... 18... 19... 20 seconds.\n\nThe itch turns into a scream. I flail, kicking my legs and twisting my body. My feet touch the bottom, and I kick off hard, trying to break the surface, but she just shoves me down harder. I don't stand a chance.\n\nA cold realization washes over me, colder than the water. I’m not getting out. If I pass out, I'll automatically inhale. I’m fucked.\n\nThe fight drains out of me. I go limp. The edges of my vision darken. Spots bloom behind my eyelids. My chest feels like it’s going to collapse. I close my eyes and accept it.\n\nJust as I give up completely, I’m yanked violently out of the water. I gasp, choking on air and chlorinated water. A slap cracks across my face, sharp enough to make my nose bleed instantly.\n\n\"Don't fucking pretend to be dead, asshole,\" she barks, \"or next time I'll leave you floating here for real.\"\n\nShe turns and walks back inside, leaving me coughing on the concrete, blood dripping into the water.\n\n\"I wish...\" I think, shivering.\n\n\"I wish I was never born.\""

I fixed it hopefully it's better to read, my apologies 😭)\n\n\nSo about 3 years ago my aunt came down front St Thomas and she was staying with us ( me, My dad, 2 brothers, uncle, and grandpa). I liked having her around she was cool but she is also lesbian which my grandpa did not like bc he homophobic. He is also biased to her as well calling only he out for the same things that my uncles do, like one example, both my uncle and my aunt do weed, my aunt never smokes it in front of us, neither does my uncle, but for some reason he told her that he doesn't want her doing that around us. I don't believe it was about the weed, I believe it was the fact she was bringing her gf around us, which I don't mind I liked her gf she was cool. So there was one day where both my dad and my aunty was picking me up from school, and I saw my aunty was crying and she was talking about how she wants to leave and get out of her, and I found out later that my grandpa was yelling at her for something (I have no idea what it was). Apparently my aunty had put her ear plugs on and was ignoring him. My grandpa did not like that so he jump on her and started to choke her and suffocate her. She was trying to say she couldn't breath but my grandpa didn't stop, she got so scared that she urinated. My uncle and my dad had to step in and pull him off of her. When I found out I was mortified, I always knew my grandpa put his hands on women Ive witnesses it ever since I was a little girl, but to do it to his own daughter, it scares me. I was afraid he'd put his hands on me too, so one day I decided to bring it up and I told him how what he did wasn't right. I understand that my aunty putting in her headphones was disrespectful but what he did crossed the line and I told him it bothered me. But in   me doing so he completely went ballistic, he screamed and yelled and shouted at me for hours, non stop. I still didn't changed my mind if anything him doing that solidified what I thought, that it was wrong and he pushed the line, he almost killed her. I told my dad how I can't look up to him because of how he treats women, I can't look up to him as my protector when he hurts people like that, how could ever I want to be someone like him??? "

It's not something we necessarily plan, but almost ever since we've been together, we go to a party once or twice a month, and we get drunk. She'll buy me alcohol or maybe our friends will buy it for us. But always, by the end of the night, we'll both be blackout drunk; and have sex. \n\nKnowing that this might happen, i'll bring condoms with me. But sometimes, I don't anticipate it, or my girlfriend will ask to do it with no protection. Considering we're both drunk, we can't stop to think about not having sex, or to perhaps try and get protection. So, we'll just have sex without it.\n\nOften times, we'll wake up hung over, and somewhat unsure if I had came in her. So, I'll always go to the Walgreens next to our college and buy a Plan B. \n\nA few nights ago me and my girlfriend went to this little get-together hosted by her friend. And who would've guessed, I got really drunk. The same routine occurred again; I had brought protection, but somehow I'd lost it, and my girlfriend told me it was okay to have sex without it. So we had sex, and this time I knew I came in her. So again, the next morning, I went to the same Walgreens to buy another plan B.\n\nThis time though, something happened. When I went to the register, I saw this man. I'll see him often whenever I go to this specific store. I don't go out of my way to talk to him, but he'll say hi to me sometimes. When I was about to pay for the Plan B, he started laughing. When i asked him why, he told me it was because I was buying a Plan B.\n\nI think he sensed I was a little confused by that, so he apologized, and told me it was just that him and the other employees knew me as the one who always buys Plans B. He told me this was the 9th time he had seen me buy one. He said 9 was a lucky number in his culture, so I should be happy. I laughed and said bye, and went in my car.\n\nWhen I did, I started crying. I haven't in God knows how long, but I started bawling my eyes out. i don't keep count of how many Plan Bs i've bought. But 9 fucking times? With the same person? I've probably bought more than that, but he just wasn't there.\n\nIt's not my girlfriend's fault at all. But what am I doing? I can't control myself for fucking once? I know my girlfriend doesn't want a child, yet because I can't stop myself, i'm putting us at risk of having one.\n\nEvery Plan B i've bought is another tally mark of my immaturity and my recklessness. I can't continue being like this and expect myself to be a good boyfriend or idk a good father when the time comes for us.\n"

I have a pattern I’m very aware of. I’m not dating a guy until at least a few years, but I still need to get this off my chest, so here I’ll go.\n\nFirst, I show interest. I’m very pretty, so this works 9/10 times. Then I’ll tell them I like them a lot (which I do). Then I try helping them be the best version of themselves. I try fixing their bad habits, routines, and helping them be more productive, even helping them find their goals.\n\nI’m also very loyal and I do things to make them feel special, which is genuine because at that point I really do like them. I spend a lot of time with them, really hear them out, be their safe space, and make them happy.

They’re chill as well, so they think they have found their “dream girl.”\n\nAnd then suddenly, after 3–4 months, I lose feelings, like I never even liked them. I start losing my mind because the feelings just vanish out of nowhere. The guilt starts eating me up, and I get dry and start replying late. Internally, I’m just thinking a lot and I get depressed. I even get physically sick because of the stress.\n\nThen finally, after about a month, I make up my mind: “They don’t deserve this. They are so good to me, they at least deserve someone who likes them wholeheartedly.” And then I end things. They cry, and I feel bad — I feel terrible — so I never break no contact again because of the guilt. But that’s about it. Even after ending things, I don’t feel sad. Sure, I miss them at times, but I don’t feel regretful for how things ended.\n\nThe storyline is the same for both guys, but at different timings.\n\nWith the first guy, I had genuine reasons to break up. He was clingy to the point he stopped going to college or caring about anyone else. He was so obsessed in a bad way — he would get mad if I even talked to my friends, and then he wouldn’t let me study. So I had to leave him.\n\nWith the second guy, I had bad reasons that made me question my own values and morals (I’m a big “values and morals” girl). I lost feelings, and I realized it very slowly — it took me a month. I started looking at him as a friend out of nowhere. It was fun hanging out with him, but then I started feeling uncomfortable when he tried to initiate intimacy. Even holding hands started feeling wrong.\n\nThis whole thing was so draining. I don’t think I can go through dating again. Both relationships lasted just a couple of months, not so long.\n\nI know I’m terrible for all this, but are there ways for me not to be terrible like this? I won’t be dating anyone for mine and their mental health, but I just want to fix myself. Because this wasn’t who I was initially. I was just a girl who innocently really liked someone at a point but was hurt really, really bad. Eventually, I moved on from them. I just wanted to find someone who liked me just as much. But where did it all go wrong?\n\nP.S. Both relationships were at different timings, months apart actually.\n\n\nupdate : as i was writing this post, i was very high on emotions as my break up is recent like a week ago recent, i was drowning in guilt as i felt very sorry but at the same time and i just needed an outside opinion on this. these past few days i’ve processed things well and honestly i demonised myself too much here in the post and i was over analysing things as hell i just wasnt in my best shape mentally.. im doing good now the things i considered “toxic pattern” are just part of my nature, i get along with most people, i am also a good listener so i am most of my friend’s safe spaces, i do special things for them to make them feel appreciated pushing them to be productive and get rid of their bad habits, complimenting / appreciating people all of this is just part of my nature thats what my pattern really is, now in this context sure i lost feelings but theres sm to it than i can write on a simple reddit post im not saying im right or wrong i think theres sm space for me to learn and to grow im still 18 after all, im so glad people here heard me out and like gave me a bigger wider range of view. and honestly i wish i could get therapy or whatever but my parents dont really support the idea of it i dont want to get into that but anyways yeah im just trynna do the best i can which is just heal and focus on things that truly matter to me atm and try not to hurt somebody else again. i hope everyone whose reading this peace and love and if anyone whose already given me advices below (ive read them all btw) thank you so much all of it really helped🩷 "

    "text": "Bonjour,\n\nJ'écris ici sans grand espoir d'être lu ou répondu. \nC'est un compte jetable et j'ai l'impression de jeter des ordures dans la mer, sans que personne ne les trouve...\n\nMais je pense que ça me fait du bien d'écrire ces mots, et puis j'en ressens le besoin, alors...\n\nJe suis avec mon copain depuis quasi 5 ans,\nj’ai très vite su qu'il avait un fétichisme des pieds.\n\nPar la suite, notre sexualité n'a tourné que autour de cela. Je dois dire que même si, au début, je l'ai fait par amour (et non par désir personnel, puisque je n'ai ressenti aucune attraction à susciter mon partenaire avec mes pieds), je me suis rapidement pris au jeu.\n\nD'autant plus qu'il est presque asexuel et qu'il aime seulement se soumettre, et les pieds.\n\nQuoi qu'il en soit, en bref, nous avons exploré tous les scénarios possibles \nJe dois dire que nous étions tellement dans ces illusions à un moment donné que nous avons fait des choses vraiment folles...\n\nEt si j'écris ceci ici aujourd'hui, c'est parce que le problème, c'est qu'il est accro à la pornographie (des pieds en chaussettes), qu'il s'agisse de vrai porno ou de porno hentai. \nC'est quelque chose qu'il consomme, oui, qu’il consomme, très régulièrement.\n\nEt il faut dire que cela a déjà causé beaucoup de difficultés dans notre relation, parce que j'ai vraiment du mal à tolérer son besoin d'aller sur ce type de site. Je ne me sens pas \"normal\" ou \"anormal\" à ce sujet, parce que je sais que beaucoup sont dans des situations similaires, toutes aussi délicates. « Si je suis ici, pourquoi en a-t-il besoin ? » « S'il veut le faire seul, il a mes photos... » « Pourquoi n'est-il pas satisfait de moi... ? »\n\nSentiment horrible\n\nIl passe son temps sur Pixiv, Pornhub, Rule34, et ainsi de suite... \nEn fait, partout...\nSa galerie, ses historiques en sont remplies.\n\nÀ savoir que nous nous sommes déjà séparés 3 fois en 4 ans... \nCe qui, je pense, est assez énorme en soi. \nMais à chaque fois, il y avait plus de pauses en mode : « Il vaut mieux faire une pause maintenant que d'y mettre fin définitivement plus tard.» \nEt cela nous convient.\n\nD'un autre côté, à chaque fois, nous avons continué à nous voir pour partager des moments d’intimité.\n\nCela a remplacé ma sexualité, et je dois dire que j'aime vraiment ça... \nJe préfère ça au sexe lui-même.\n\nLa dernière séparation que notre couple a subie a eu lieu en juin dernier. \nLorsque nous nous sommes remis ensemble récemment, il avait pris des photos classiques de nous lors d'une sortie et m'avait dit de prendre son téléphone pour me les envoyer (ce que j'ai fait).\n\nEn ouvrant sa galerie, à part les 38 2737297 collections de photos de pieds de femmes en chaussettes d’internet qu'il adore faire (l'un de ses fantasmes), il avait également une vidéo des jambes et des pieds en chaussures, de l'une de ses collègues de travail...\n\nJe sais qu'il n'y a rien de mal avec elle, et je sais que ce que je vais dire, chaque femme le dit avant d'apprendre une infidélité, mais : mon copain ne me trompe pas.\n\nEh bien... au moins, pas au-delà de cette vidéo. \nEt était-ce vraiment une tromperie ? \nParce que nous n'étions déjà plus vraiment en couple, \nC’était déjà froid entre nous.\n\nÀ l'époque, quand j'étais plus jeune, c'était moi qui avais déjà fauté.\nMais depuis lors, à mesure que j’ai pris de l’âge et mûri, je me suis assagie, posée, et calmée.\n\nPourtant, je me sens toujours coupable, et je me sentirais trop coupable pour le blâmer pour cette vidéo, alors qu'à l'époque c'était moi qui... \nSauf que, en soi, s'il m'a pardonné, il y a prescription. Surtout après des années de bonne conduite...\n\nJe lui en ai parlé rapidement, en particulier pour qu'il la supprime et supprime ses collections, il s'est excusé pour la vidéo, il m'a dit qu'il avait la dalle à ce moment-là... ;-;\n\n-_-\n\nJe l'aime, et pour moi, me séparer de lui n'est pas une option. \nMais dernièrement, il a une baisse de la libido dans notre relation. \n\nIl continue de regarder son contenu cependant, il sait que cela me fait mal, mais il continue... \nComme s'il en était accro, mais sans l'admettre à moi ou à lui. \nDéjà, à l'époque, je l'ai emmené voir un psychologue pour ça. \nIl n'était pas vraiment à l’aise dans les sessions, puis il les avaient arrêtés.\nMais je souffre de ce porno, avec qui j'ai l'impression qu'il est plus en couple qu'avec moi. \nJe l’adore mais c'est ennuyeux, c'est fatigant et ça fait mal.\n\nJ'ai l'impression qu'il s’en veut de me blesser à travers cela, sauf que je n'ai cette impression que lorsque je lui fais part de ma douleur... De lui-même, il ne se dit pas : « Je blesse ma femme. »\n\nBref...\n\n\n"

I'm a consultant, so the few hours I do actually work are usually spent with answering easy-to-google questions, throwing logs at LLMs to copy-paste suggestions to clients, and neatly putting all of this into internal docs to make it look like I'm busy.  \nI _did_ work hard(ish) to get to this point, but now it's literally zero effort for insane payout. I make more than 7x what my SO does as a therapist. I work _maybe_ 4 hours on a busy day, but on most days it's closer to 2. The company is 100% remote, so I spend most of my worktime doing household chores and chilling at home. All the clients and colleagues I work with praise my work ethic and the effort I put into my tasks. Every 2 weeks I have a quick check in with my boss, and each time I get commended for the good work I do. This week I've spent more time playing video games than actually working.\n\nI don't even keep this a secret with friends and family, but everyone always assumes I'm exaggerating or oversimplifying my job. I'm not. They hired me because I have a good bit of experience in an abstract part of the field, but my job doesn't actually need me to use deep knowledge."

I told her that I didn’t want to have actual intercourse but everything else was on the table. This is because I was a virgin and wanted to save this moment for later. She asked me again later and I gave in. Why. Why did I do this. Now I’ve been beating myself up ever since and feel like I’ve lost all my dignity. To make matters worse I confessed this to a few people close to me. I’m convinced I have some sickness. I wish I could go back to life beforehand. I was already clinically depressed but this is like throwing a whole can of gas on a fire. Yes it is my fault, yes I should take responsibility but it’s too much for me to bear. "

    "text": "This was my senior year of high school in 2006/2007 and I was working for the “school store”.  It was essentially a snack shop only open during lunch. We sold chips, cookies, candy and various bottled drinks. We also sold t-shirts and hoodies but that had to go through the athletic director who was in charge. All regular sized items for cheap. Details are fuzzy given that this was 18 years ago but if I remember correctly it was like $0.75-1.25 for all snacks and $1.50-2.00 for drinks. It was typically 3 students and the our AD doing the selling.\n\nThere was very little organization and we didn’t use a cash register or anything like that. Probably because the space we were in was very small and registers would have taken too much counter space. We’d be handed a stack of cash and would just start distributing the goods. And it’s not like we were wearing a fanny pack to hold the money either. Sometimes I’d be wearing a hoodie and would just have everything in my front pocket. Well after a few weeks I noticed that the amount of money we were handed each time was never the same amount. \n\nSo I started small. A couple bucks, maybe even $5, every other week. No change, no alarm bells. Hmm. Maybe I can do more. Sometimes I’d take a little something every day. Still no alarm bells. One time I took $40. I was sweating bullets that day. By the end of the year I think had probably taken about $500-600. No one ever said anything. And I was the only student who stayed the whole year, a few different people cycled through. We didn’t get “paid” so to speak, but we got a snack and a drink each day. Also because you worked nearly the entire lunch period, by the time the shop closed, you might have 5 minutes to actually eat your lunch before your next class. \n\nI’m not even sure how I got the job to begin with but I’m grateful for the experience. We didn’t have a ton of money growing up so sometimes my lunch just a sandwich. That snack and drink helped a lot. Obviously I don’t condone my behavior but I was a dumb 17 year old. \n\nDon’t steal, kids. Stay in school. "

    "text": "So I had this friend who I was close with. Our friendship started through someone else and we both took to liking each other quite quick. We were physical, and also sexted a lot; they had experience with many people since they were 13 which worried me a little. Personally I had only a year experience with one person, a romantic partner but I was also exposed to sexuality online at a very young age (maybe 7 or 8 on), just like them, probably to damaging effects. This situation continued for a few months, we were physical offline twice, and it was fun for us both, we also talked about clothes, cooking, plants, holidays etc.\n\n Life events that Summer made me feel like I was losing control of my life, for one I wasn't able to go to the college I wanted which many of my friends were going to. I began to spiral, including one conversation with the above mentioned person where I (I really regret this) rudely rejected their attempts to give me hope and encourage me to act for myself, I was giving up on myself. I turned to sex as a coping mechanism and over the next few days, I repeatedly asked this person if they wanted to sext, each day or each other day for about five days. I suppose I thought eventually they'd be interested and have the energy but in reality, I guess it was just a bunch of extra pressure while they were just about to start another year of school, worsened by the fact some of their other friends had been mean to them; I think I said it would comfort them as well/also offer them an escape, but I now look back at disgust at saying that. Luckily they kept saying no and when I realised it wasn't simply something they didn't have the energy for that day, but something they actively didn't want to do, after the five (maybe four, maybe six) days, I stopped asking. I went out on a walk and took photos of nature and sent them to them and they said they were pretty. It was like emerging from a hole.\n\nOver the next two months, we talked still but I never asked to sext again and neither did they, I voluntarily started therapy to help cope better but I didn't discuss this; I also tried to confront my parents over my life direction but it didn't go very well. I was still a bit obsessive I fear with my friend over these months, I made sure not to bring up sex for fear of violating their boundaries but, looking back, that wasn't good enough, I was self deprecating and talked to them constantly, asking questions about their college, how they were and stuff. After the two months, they stopped talking to me except in simple responses and it made me realise how I'd gone basically insane over the whole thing, it made me realise what I had done and been from their perspective. I saw them post a tiktok about hating one of their old friends which could have been one of those people from their school or possibly myself, and I didn't feel like it was my place to ask. I apologised on Instagram where I said I shouldn't have broken their boundaries, that nothing they did warranted it, that they were really nice to me and ultimately that I won't bother them anymore; they hearted it. A month later, I wished them a happy birthday, they hearted that and said thanks, that was the last time we talked; they also liked a instagram post I made a few days after that. Eventually we unfollowed each other without talking about it.\n\nI feel so bad about the whole thing, especially but not only those five or so days. Every time I try to talk about it I get worried or, I suppose here where I mentioned my kinda irrelevant young exposure to sexuality and stuff, try to excuse it but its not excusable. Over the last few years I tried to move on but now, I am in a place where I am not in education and only looking for work, so the only thing I wake up to everyday is the past. The guilt I feel has began to keep me up at night. I don't know if this is what I deserve or if moving on is the only way I make sure I don't hurt anyone else or if I am a bad person for thinking I should ever move on. I did talk to deepseek recently who, obviously biased to me tbf and I know I shouldn't trust AI, said that I should learn from it but that it doesn't define me and I am not a sex pest because intent to harm wasn't there and it wasn't repetitive but I don't think I should forgive myself so easily. It also said I should talk to a therapist about it. I have thought about apologising, or just talking to them, again but I won't because I know that is more in my interest than theirs and I shouldn't make myself out to be either a hero or a victim here.\n\nI had a casual experience with another friend lately and felt worried I had made them uncomfortable that I sent them a paragraph apology and they said that they enjoyed it more than me and that I overthink way too much, even that they may ask to do it again. I hope this is just me overthinking like that was although I know, at the same time, I could be underplaying my responsibility to myself to protect my own image of myself and what I did was even worse than I think. So what do I do moving forward and how should I look back moving forward?"

    "text": "I park a couple blocks from home, kill the engine, and just… exist. No radio, sometimes a podcast, sometimes I stare at a leaf on the windshield. I text “traffic” to the family group chat and sit there like a raccoon pretending to be a functioning adult.\n\nIt started during a rough week. I told myself I needed five minutes to decompress so I wouldn’t bring the office home. Five minutes became fifteen, then an hour. Now that quiet metal box is the only place where nobody needs anything from me.\n\nHere’s the part I’m not proud of: I’ve missed dinners. I’ve let calls ring out. I’ve walked in with a tired smile and a lie about a stalled truck on the highway (there’s always a stalled truck somewhere, even when I’m nowhere near a highway). I’m not cheating. I’m not job-hunting. I’m just exhausted and addicted to being unreachable.\n\nI think I’m scared that if I say “I need an hour to myself,” people will hear “I don’t love you.” So I picked the coward’s version—silence and excuses. It feels harmless, but it isn’t. It chips away at trust, and I can hear it in the little pause before they say “okay.”\n\nI’m confessing because I don’t want the happiest part of my day to be hiding. I’m going to tell them the truth and ask for a real boundary: one hour after work, phone on Do Not Disturb, then I show up fully. If they say no, at least I finally said something real.\n\nIf anyone else does the car-park thing: you’re not a monster. But the quiet hits different when it isn’t stolen.\n"

I spend hours in my car after work just sittingg there, crying, staring at nothing. Sometimes it’s in the bathroom before anyone sees me. I tell myself I’m fine in the mirror, put on the smile, the laugh, the casual jokes, amd then go home and feel completely hollow.\n\nI don’t even know why I do it. Part of me wants someone to notice to ask if I’m okay, but another part is terrified of anyone seeing the real me. People tell me I’m inspiring or strong and I just nod and hope they never see what it actually takes to “be me.”\n\nI guess this is my confession..most of the confidence and poise people see is just smoke and mirrors.

    "text": "A few days ago, something happened that still lingers in my mind like a vivid dream. One of my university friend let’s call her [ilu](https://share.google/WsUxjnbYFMCf4X15V) , Came over to my room one night. She’s always been a little mean, sharp with her words, bossy in her ways… and honestly, that’s what drew me to her. I’ve always had a weakness for bossy women. With her, I felt a mix of obedience and attraction I could never quite hide.\n\nWe used to hang out everywhere—late-night city rides, random adventures, and sometimes sharing confessions that were more than a little erotic😹. I often skipped wearing underwear around her, and there were moments when I knew my body [betrayed me](https://share.google/rWiFFdtNq9t4d7Kxz), though I never really knew if she noticed🫣. When she finished her course and went back to her hometown, I missed those days more than I admitted.\n\nThat night, though, she was back and she was coming over to my space. I’d promised to give her the “princess treatment,” so I was already in the kitchen, cooking her favorite food. I wore only a pair of [high rise shorts](https://www.ajio.com/lulu-sky-women-high-rise-shorts/p/700804488_turquoise), almost like girls’ shorts(My ex gf gift🤪), and I was sweating from the heat. For me, it wasn’t just about feeding her it was about caring for her, attending to her needs like she deserved.\n\nThe door opened. She stepped inside, and when she saw me, her eyes widened in surprise🫣. She had never seen me like this before: half-dressed, apron-free, standing at the stove, cooking for her.\n\nShe smirked. “I don’t have any dress to change, what will I wear?”\n\nI froze for a moment, glancing back at her. “Ooh, sorry… I don’t have any shorts, only T-shirts. What will we do?”\n\nShe tilted her head, a playful glint in her eyes. She knew exactly how to handle situations like this. “Okh… give me a T-shirt. I’ll be fine with that.”\n\nThat sentence alone sent a sensation straight down my body. My breath caught as I said, “Sure! Take this.”\n\nI handed her one of my T-shirts. She slipped [lit on casually](https://share.google/b1CEKibJu0u26daXm), right over her [black sheer bra and panties](https://share.google/uDvLJCHwohbK7nGN3). The thin cotton clung lightly to her body, hinting at everything underneath. She strolled into the kitchen and hopped onto the slab opposite me, legs crossed, music playing softly from her phone. From where I stood, I had the perfect view her black sheer panties, her bare thighs, the faint sway of her foot to the rhythm of the song.\n\nI tried to focus on the food, but I was vibing with the music, stealing glances at her without realizing. I must have gotten carried away, because I forgot to stir properly, and a faint burnt smell began to rise.\n\nBefore I could react, she have a [Fackelmann Bamboo Slotted Turner](https://share.google/aeyfgurlbXpj6IG8V) in her hands at that time. With no warning, she leaned forward and gave me a sharp smack on my backside🥵\n\nThe sound cracked through the air.\nThe sting rushed through me.\nAnd the sound that left my mouth—“[Awffh… aaaah…🥵😭](https://share.google/tQxSdTGmvM0yxVQfE)”escaped from somewhere deep, from my inner soul.\n\nIn that instant, everything shifted. My mind snapped back to the food, and I quickly mixed it to save what I could. She pulled back, her cheeks slightly flushed. “I’m really sorry, dear…🙊🤭” she said, almost shyly, though her tone carried amusement.\n\nI turned, catching the blush on her cheeks, and felt my own face heat up. The situation made me feel like a househusband cooking, nervous, obedient while she sat nearby, casually holding a bamboo turner like a queen with her scepter.\n\nMy heart raced. I felt both embarrassed and thrilled, as if I was playing a role I secretly craved.\n\nWe settled into the moment again. Drinks were poured, laughter flowed, and [she lit a cigarette. Sitting cross-legged on the counter](https://share.google/3OIx5fWe7Ah1kHvfR), smoke curling lazily around her, she looked like she belonged there commanding the room without effort. The T-shirt had ridden up slightly, and from the angle, I could see the smooth line of her thighs leading up to the sheer fabric of her panties.\n\nThe music hummed low. The food simmered. My nerves danced on edge. And all the while, she watched me with that knowing expression the kind that said she understood exactly the effect she had on me, and she enjoyed every second of it.\n"

    "text": "I (19M) grew up in a single household with my mom and sister where nudity was normal and nothing was off-limits. My mom and sister are both , confident, plus-size women very well-endowed in the chest and butt area. They never hid their bodies, and it was just part of our everyday life.\n\nI’ve always been the opposite skinny, without an ounce of their curves. But I did develop… elsewhere.\n\nI’ll never forget this one time when I was around 13. I was sweeping the kitchen nude, and not paying attention to much else. My mom walked by, glanced down, and laughed. She said, “Be careful with that thing, you’re gonna sweep the floor with it before the broom does!”\n\nYeah. She joked that my… “gbola”… was as long as the broom handle.\n\nIt was beyond awkward at the time, but honestly? It stuck with me. In her own weird way, she was letting me know I had nothing to be insecure about. She always said they were “blessed with curves,” and I was “blessed down below.”\n\nThat kind of honesty was just normal in our house. It gave me a level of body confidence most guys my age didn’t have, even if it came with a side of permanent awkwardness.\n\nNow, I realize how much that shaped my confidence and my taste. I’m naturally drawn to strong, curvy women because that’s what felt like home: real, unapologetic, and powerful.\n\nAnyone else’s family give them wildly awkward confidence boosts?"

    "text": "To be frank, I hate this country's medical system with a passion.  My insurance is shit but expensive.  I find it deplorable.  So, anytime I need to go to a specialist or urgent care, I just throw the bills away.  I have an 800+ credit score.  They send it to collections.  I ignore that too.  Eventually they just go away.  They can't touch me.\n\nA 10 minute dermatologist appointment with an inconclusive resolution should not cost an additional $250, that I get an unexpected bill for a month later. So I just don't pay it.  Done this 4 or 5 times over the years.  No consequences in the slightest so far. Don't feel a lick of guilt.  I genuinely think I am just taking what I deserve.\n\nMaybe that dermatologist wouldn't let me make another appointment?  I don't know, don't care.  Plenty of doctors out there.  Fuck em all.\n\nEdit: all these people saying it’s gonna catch up eventually are actual brainwashed morons. It’s been 4-5 bills of $250 or less over years of my life. If they’ve got you living in such fear that something like that will drastically affect your life, you are a sucker. Sorry. You believe all the lies. I pay my co pay. I pay my insurance. When the appointment ends, nothing tells me that the insurance company or office is going to send me a completely separate bill. I will not pay that. That is bullshit money. If you do, you’re fucking stupid. \n\nEdit2: I should confess more often. This has been great. And I’ve really enjoyed the wide variety of thoughts and comments support and derision I’ve received.  I’m trying to read them all. It’s an important conversation, at the least. "

She went down a rough path with a man she shouldn't have ever involved herself with. \nI had to call cps bc of her doing drugs around her baby. I didn't want to, but I couldn't live with myself if I didn't and something had happened.\n(2022) She didn't want to speak to me ever again. \nThe guy died last year. I tried reaching out, don't know how to reach her.\n\n((I have changed the names for the story)) \nI have been completely devastated for the past 3 years because I followed my morals and stood my ground with boundaries. I can admit I have been a horrible person and friend in my past. I have done things that I wish I did not. We all have. But I have grown.\n\nI am 27 now. I have grown a lot mentally and emotionally as a woman. It is hard being raised by parents who are not emotionally intelligent and you have to navigate your mistakes and learn how to take accountability and also give grace. Forgiveness.\n\nI had a friend from high school go down a rough path.\n\nShe and I had gotten pregnant together back in 2019. We went through COVID together on FaceTime raising our children. She was my best friend. My soul sister. She made me laugh like no other. I have not ever met anyone like her and I miss her every single day and she is alive.\n\nShe got pregnant by her high school sweetheart but they were not together when she got pregnant. He ended up marrying someone else and was in the military stationed states away.\n\nMy best friend was living with her mom. Her baby daddy’s family would get the baby every other weekend and she would go out and party. She had a rough relationship with her mom and was constantly telling me about how she wanted to move out. \nHer mom had a boyfriend, Joseph, who was close with his family. Joseph has a sister named Aly, she had been married to a guy named Willy who she has 2 sons with.\n\nSo this guy Willy is basically like an ex uncle to my best friend. She had known him since she was 16. He was just still in good standing with the family & would come around. \nWilly offered my friend a job as a live-in nanny at his girlfriend, Cindy's house. \n\nMy best friend was excited. She took the offer. Moved out right after a fight with her mom.\n\nIt was fun at first. This was 2021. She was 23 and life was looking up. She was getting child support from her baby daddy. Getting paid to babysit. She got to party. Invite friends over when she had nights off. I even went over there once to hang out with her. Her baby would not go to sleep. She was getting so frustrated. And that is when she told me she gave her melatonin. Her baby was barely one.\n\nI told her not to be doing that. I did not even know what melatonin was until I was grown. My mom started calling her Casey Anthony after that. But that was just a trailer for what was about to come.\n\nI was in the military so I was not around in person much. But the things she told me…\n\nShe started complaining that Cindy was never home. That she was stuck watching her kids constantly. That Willy told her to stop. He told Cindy to go home to her kids and he told my best friend to just come hang out at his apartment in downtown Houston. So she did...\n\nHe provided the party favors. Their favorite was the sugar booger. She had a long history with that since high school. None of it surprised me. But he was old. Like 40. We were 23. I told her it was weird. He was unattractive. Creepy.\n\nShe said he was chill. He paid for everything. Even Cindy would join them and party. He let her invite friends too. But I lived states away. I never went. Eventually she told me she was working as his assistant. He was going to put her on his payroll. She moved in with him. No more nannying. She lived there. With her daughter.\n\nThen she told me she had slept with him. Twice. Said she was drunk and high. Said it did not start that way. \nThat he always treated her nice. Complimented her. Made her feel good. \nShe said she started finding him attractive. \nI was blown away. He had been married twice. Had three kids. Knew her since she was 16. I asked her what about Cindy. And she told me Cindy was there too. That they had threesomes. It made my stomach turn. I was so confused. She never used to act like this.\n\nWe had a group chat with another friend Lice. We were planning a trip for spring break 2022. One day she called me and Lice and told us she could not go anymore. She was in a serious relationship now. I flipped out. I called her and went off.\n\nShe told me she and Willy were together. That she really liked him. They were serious.\n\nDays before this conversation she had partied too hard. Took a bar. Forgot hours of the night. Her daughter was home. Willy was there. She had to lie to the baby daddy’s family and ask them to come pick the baby up. She did not tell them she was high. But she told me.\n\nI was in shock. But at this point I knew it was too far gone. I told her mom. I was not close with her dad’s side. And I had bad blood with other parts of her family.\n\nA few days before all that she had given me her Snapchat login. So I logged in. I saw everything.\n\nBloody noses from sugar booger. Her daughter asleep in bed next to her. Her high out of her mind. Willy sitting in the corner like it was nothing. I was sick. Sick to my stomach.\n\nI told everyone I thought would help the situation and get the baby out of there. Her mom. Her baby daddy. I was terrified for her daughter.\n\nShe had already told me she never wanted to speak to me again. Said I betrayed her. Said if I really loved her I would not have done that.\n\nShe went off on Twitter. Said ugly things about me. And out of pain and anger I exposed the Snapchat stuff. Posted it publicly. It shut her up. But not in the way I intended.\n\nA mutual friend messaged me and told me I needed to take it down. That if I ever loved her I would not post things like that. She was right. I took it down. She also admitted everything my best friend was doing was out of order. I was sick over the baby being around all of that. I did not know it was happening when she had her. I thought it was only on the weekends she was gone.\n\nWilly had her number turned off. No one could reach her. I called CPS. I reported everything. Her mom told me whoever called ruined her life. I never admitted it was me.\n\nMy best friend disappeared. Cut contact with everyone. Willy moved her to a foreign Asian country. Trying to hide money through a tax loophole. She tried to take her daughter. Her baby daddy said no. He went to court. He got custody. She got pregnant while overseas. Had another baby girl. They eventually moved back.\n\nHer mom messaged me in August 2024 and told me she was back and had another baby. But still no contact with her daughter. Then in October 2024 she messaged me again.\n\nWilly had died. Heart attack. Age 44. My first thought was that the sugar booger caught up to him. But I also felt hope. Hope that I might get my friend back.\n\nI asked her mom for her number. She did not have it. Said she still would not talk to her. Said she was staying with Aly now. Willy’s ex wife. Aly helped her get a car. A job. She was doing better but still shut off from her family.\n\nFound Aly's facebook, I messaged her, let her know I was an old friend. Gave her my info and told her how i loved my friend. And the lady blocked me.\n\nThat hurt. I know I cannot force anyone to be in my life. But it still hurts. I never stopped caring about her. I never will.\n\nShe was my soul sister.\n\nAnd I still do not know how to live with the fact that she is alive and I cannot reach her.\n\nAll I can do now is pray. Pray she heals. Pray she finds Christ. Pray she knows I loved her the entire time."

    "text": "I work in a warehouse and most of the women there wear shorts or yoga pants. There is one female coworker who has the most amazing ass I've ever seen. She and I are friendly but we don't work \"together\". We see each other in passing or to exchange a hello.\n\nEvery time she walks away, I can't help staring at her ass. It's perfect! Just the right size and shape. I have pictured that ass many times when I've been having some \"me\" time.\n\nI never say or do anything creepy as I'm about twice her age, but GODDAMN! "

    "text": "M(33), There’s a strange thrill in talking to strangers. That moment of stepping into the unknown, not sure what stories you’ll uncover, what quirks you’ll notice, or what fleeting connections you’ll make. Some conversations fade as quickly as they start, while others linger in your head long after they’re done.\n\nStrangers have no expectations, no history with you and that’s what makes it liberating. Every word, every laugh, every awkward silence has the potential to open a tiny window into a whole different world.\n\nTalking to strangers is not just small talk. It’s adventure in its simplest form."
